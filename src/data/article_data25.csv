1,Culture and domestic violence,News,2020-06-26T00:49:35.673Z,"Let’s think harder about how to encourage safer families
 
 The scourge of domestic violence has come out of the shadows of Australian society in recent years, and for the better. The campaigns to reduce its incidence have a resonance and authority that other efforts to achieve social change can learn a lot from. But the reluctance of some involved in working to stop domestic violence to look beyond one-size-fits-all solutions is self-defeating. A case in point is the lack of plain thinking around how to confront the disproportionate incidence of domestic violence among indigenous communities. Nicola Berkovic reported in The Australian this week that, across the 10 years to 2015-16, 23 per cent of intimate partner homicide victims were indigenous. The Australian Institute of Criminology data also revealed that another 22 per cent of these victims came from an overseas-born background. Obviously, such outcomes indicate strongly where the investment in preventing domestic violence should be directed.
 
 However, as Jacinta Nampijinpa Price pointed out in The Australian’s commentary pages on Wednesday, there is a prevailing view among organisations campaigning against domestic violence that suggests indigenous men who hurt their partners and family members should not be held wholly to blame for their actions. This despite the fact indigenous women are likelier to be the targets of violence, tend to suffer more severe abuse than non-indigenous women and find it harder to overcome community resistance to addressing the violence they are subjected to. Why should colonisation and not the cultural drivers in indigenous communities themselves be the reason for this?
 
 Ms Price, a Warlpiri-Celtic woman from Alice Springs, knows something about domestic violence. “As a girl growing up I saw other girls my age reach adolescence and then be married off to much older men while still too young to be legally married under Australian law,” Ms Price said. “I witnessed women being brutally beaten by their husbands, but the cultural acceptance of it was so strong no one besides my immediate family supported the victim or reported the abuse.” It is difficult to see how the historical impacts of colonisation were working to create such circumstances.
 
 The Institute of Criminology figures also suggest that a disproportionate number of women from a migrant background are subjected to domestic violence. That should encourage more questions over whether issues of culture can explain such an outcome. Instead, asking such questions is condemned immediately as pushing an agenda that somehow denies violence against women is an issue that all cultures should address.Reflecting on the high incidence of partner homicides among indigenous and overseas-born Australians is not a means to excuse domestic violence occurring in any other part of Australian society. Family violence is a national disgrace that the nation as a whole must own and work to reduce. But that makes it doubly important that the programs and funding aimed at stopping domestic violence, no matter where it occurs, are as effective as possible. Ms Price points out that official audits of some programs have found there has been scant attention paid to what works to reduce domestic violence and what does not. Surely proper evaluation will encourage safer families.",542
2,CULTURE TO BLAME FOR MUCH OF THIS FAMILY VIOLENCE,News,2021-05-13T07:31:54.309Z,"Surely a 13-year-old girl is too young to become the wife of a 50-year-old man
 
 With 23 per cent of partner homicide victims in Australia being ­indigenous, it is not time to worry about superficial concerns such as “changing the date”. Let’s prioritise fact over politeness and action over symbolism. Too many lives depend on this.
 
 Vast amounts of taxpayer funds are spent every year on ­addressing this issue, yet very little appears to be achieved in reducing the rates of violence and death.
 
 Nicola Berkovic’s recent report on this in The Australian highlighted that, in the decade to 2016, almost a quarter of partner homicide victims in Australia were indigenous (another 22 per cent were from migrant communities).
 
 Heather Nancarrow, chief executive of Australia’s National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety, was quoted as saying “the complex drivers of family violence in indigenous communities showed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander solutions” were needed “which may differ greatly from non-indigenous solutions”.
 
 Research by ANROWS disputes the overwhelming findings that customary law and cultural influences — in particular traditional “men’s business” — are significant drivers in indigenous violence against women. Instead the organisation suggests the “historical impacts of colonisation” are to blame. This exonerates violent offenders but, sadly, is a conclusion shared by many publicly funded organisations out to tackle indigenous family violence.
 
 Our Watch is another organisation promoting this view, which perpetuates the narrative that ­Aboriginal perpetrators of violence are themselves victims of the brutality of colonisation and therefore cannot take full responsibility for their actions.
 
 Such conclusions are not ­reflective of the experience of we Aboriginal women who have survived within the confines of traditional Aboriginal culture. Those of us who have lived our lives on traditional cultural terms have first-hand knowledge of the cultural drivers of family violence.
 
 As a girl growing up I saw other girls my age reach adolescence and then be married off to much older men while still too young to be legally married under Australian law. I witnessed women being brutally beaten by their husbands, but the cultural acceptance of it was so strong no one besides my immediate family supported the victim or reported the abuse.
 
 Ignoring cultural drivers does not allow for robust examination and debate to take place that may carve out better ways of addressing such a debilitating issue. One has only to look up the book on Ngarra Law to understand not only how traditional Yolngu law accepts violence against women — and make no mistake: this is common for many Aboriginal groups.
 
 The following quote can be found under the chapter titled Marriage Law of the Ngarra Law written by Yolngu elders: “When a promised bride has reached sexual maturity her promised husband may take her for his wife. A 40 or 50-year-old man has spent his life learning the Ngarra law. His new wife might only be 13 to 16 years old and she will be sexually mature but she will not know much about the law. Yet when she marries him, she has the right to learn from him all the law that he knows that took him a lifetime to learn. But if she breaks the marriage law she must be speared through the leg. If the husband does not want to ­punish her then her mother or brother or sister will punish her, perhaps by hitting her with a heavy nulla nulla.” In the era of #MeToo not a single taxpayer-funded organisation designed to tackle Aboriginal ­family violence, violence against women or child abuse in Aboriginal communities has taken ­umbrage with the writings found within the Ngarra Law book.
 
 Surely a girl 13 to 16 years old cannot be considered able to ­become a wife to a man aged 40 or 50. Do such organisations believe in upholding the human rights of children, given it is stated 13 to 16-year-old Aboriginal girls are considered to be sexually mature? Is it not a human rights violation to spear a girl of 13 to 16 through the leg should she be found guilty of breaking traditional cultural law?
 
 The irony is that ANROWS is undertaking research titled Understanding the Role of Law and Culture in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Communities in Responding To and Preventing Family Violence. Its website states: “Through yarning methodologies and community-led discussions, the project will explore the ways in which traditional law and culture promote social order and aid in conflict resolution, punishment and rehabilitation.” ANROWS may want to be more reticent before declaring what is needed to fix the problem of domestic violence in indigenous communities. It was established as part of the National Plan to ­Reduce Violence Against Women and Their Children 2010-22.
 
 An Australian National Audit Office report found that research funding for this national plan — which includes $8m for ANROWS’s perpetrator intervention stream — has focused mostly on “the experience of people from particular cohorts or in specific contexts with limited emphasis on evaluating which services are working”.
 
 The audit also found that only a “small number of projects focused on reviewing or evaluating a service or service delivery approach”. Perhaps ANROWS has gathered useful information from its consultations with indigenous communities. But, based on the evidence gathered so far, it cannot say def­initively what does and does not work when it comes to ­reducing indigenous domestic ­violence.
 
 Indigenous partner homicide rates are high in comparison with the rest of Australia because of the underlying cultural forces that perpetuate the family violence epidemic. As taxpayers and concerned fellow Australians we should demand our financial contributions towards solving these ­ongoing issues be better spent where common sense prevails, the truth is prioritised, and diligent, evidence-based research forms the basis for problem solving.This is an edited extract of a speech Centre for Independent Studies Indigenous research director Jacinta Nampijinpa Price will deliver on Thursday in Sydney.

3,Deadly menace of family violence must be quelled,News,2021-05-26T21:55:10.894Z,"Authorities must redraw their strategies to protect victims
 
 No legislation, however prescriptive, can entirely eradicate violence and coercion or ensure civilised behaviour behind closed doors. Police, welfare service agencies or the legal system, however proactive their strategies, cannot eliminate domestic violence. That said, our society must do far more to prevent it, reduce its deadly consequences and free its victims from fear and torment. An outpouring of revelations and vigorous discussion since ex-footballer Rowan Baxter, 41, killed wife Hannah Clarke, 31, and their three young children when he ambushed their car, doused them in petrol and set them alight on their way to school in Brisbane 10 days ago have thrown up pointers as to where authorities should start.
 
 The size of the problem needs to be acknowledged, however grim a picture it paints of our society. The latest data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reveals one woman is killed every nine days and one man is killed every 29 days by a partner. One in six women and one in 16 men have experienced physical or sexual violence from a current or previous cohabiting partner. Specialist homeless services assisted 26,500 children aged nine and younger due to domestic violence in 2017-18. Disabled people and Aborigines are among those most at risk of suffering domestic violence. Nor are those in same-sex relationships immune. The problem is universal.
 
 Domestic violence protection orders are effective in many cases, but a more effective system is needed. Authorities should pay closer attention to cases where complainants report abuse by perpetrators with a history of domstic violence.
 
 DVOs are in place in one-third of domestic and family violence killings in Queensland. Baxter had a DVO against him and was facing a charge of breaching it when he murdered Ms Clarke and their ­ children and then killed himself. Her final months were marked by ­repeated contact with the system that failed to protect her. She had every reason to be frightened of her estranged husband. As national crime correspondent David Murray revealed last week, Baxter had told her how he had planned to murder a former partner and young son from a previous relationship.
 
 Support services and police resources, being limited, should be applied to help abuse victims when they are at their most vulnerable — at the time they are attempting to break free from perpetrators, or in the months immediately afterwards. White Ribbon Australia, which focuses on preventing men’s violence against women, reports women are especially vulnerable to post-separation violence and intimidation, including stalking, threats of murder, abuse of children and sexual assault.
 
 Men’s advocates highlight the plight of male victims. Those victims also deserve support. But to put the issue in context, from 2010 to 2014, fewer women (28) killed their male partners than males killed their female partners (121). The majority of women who killed their male partners were domstic violence victims of those men. That was not the case with the vast majority of the male killers.
 
 On Saturday, Sarah Elks focused on the issue of “coercive control’’ in domestic relationships — threats, intimidation, isolation from friends, family and work, and other demeaning behaviour. Such highly controlling conduct, Women’s Legal Service Queensland chief executive Angela Lynch said, was a “red flag for murder’’. For that reason, the states have good reason to examine the pros and cons of legislating to create a new domestic violence criminal offence­ of “coercive control”. As Elks writes on Monday, domestic violence survivors are also set to gain a direct voice to policymakers, with the Palaszczuk government considering a Victorian-style council for victims and survivors. Consultation makes sense.Those who have endured and survived relationships in which basic human decency is as elusive as gold dust are well placed to advise authorities on how to tackle a dark social issue. But finding solutions to this shameful blight on our society will be complex and difficult.",669
4,Equality doesn't apply in quarantine,Fairfax,2021-06-22T12:32:12.626Z,"Lifestyles! Of the rich and famous. They're always complaining ... they're always complaining ... as they stroll around their 45-hectare properties enjoying the fresh air as they undergo 14-day quarantine at the luxury abode of their choice.
 
 From Nicole Kidman spending two weeks at her sprawling Southern Highlands estate, to Dannii Minogue receiving a medical exemption due to claustrophobia and allowed to quarantine at home, Hollywood star Tom Hanks shacking up in a Gold Coast resort, and Mark Wahlberg opting for a luxury Byron Bay pad, it seems those with famous faces and big bank accounts are allowed to escape being locked up in a small box in a hotel for two weeks - while paying thousands of dollars for the experience.
 
 It's not just Hollywood A-Listers and TV stars who get a different set of rules. Billionaire media mogul Kerry Stokes and his wife were also granted an exemption to self-quarantine at home after returning from a trip to the Colorado ski fields.
 
 While there has been an outcry from the Australian public about the fact that there seems to be one rule for the rich and one for the poor, I have to ask, are you surprised?
 
 The notion that people across the socioeconomic spectrum would be treated equally in our wide brown land is a bit of a furphy, or possibly a fantasy that we tell our children. Whether it's Indigenous woman Tanya Day being locked up for being drunk in public, while we accept this behaviour at the Melbourne Cup, there are certain benefits wealth and whiteness get you in this country.
 
 Let's look at the recent finding by Victorian Ombudsman Deborah Glass in her investigation into the lockdown of the public housing towers. In a move found to violate human rights, the residents of the towers were locked up without warning during the second wave of COVID-19, while the rest of the city was given time to collect the necessities and prepare themselves.
 
 Of course, there are people who are deservedly granted hotel quarantine exemptions. Airline crews, foreign diplomats, Australian government officials and unaccompanied minors are allowed to self-isolate at home, as are those with ""strong compassionate or medical grounds"".
 
 But these exemptions are rarely granted to the average Australian, despite increasing mental health concerns about hotel quarantine.
 
 It's nice to think of a world where the rich and powerful are meted out the same treatment as those stuck at the bottom of the ladder. But it's hard to see a world where that will happen any time soon.

5,Footy can take lead from NRL,News,2020-03-11T09:03:41.008Z,"THERE is an elitist view, albeit one that is admittedly bolstered by former NRL star Todd Carney’s unusual way of going to the bathroom, that rugby league has an unassailable monopoly on boorish behaviour in this country.
 
 It’s a view that is held and expressed with smug gusto in AFL circles. The reality now is that when it comes to the most serious category of unpleasant male behaviour – violence towards women – the AFL is in fact sadly lagging behind the NRL.
 
 For all the flak league has generated through its many headline-grabbing moments, the AFL could take a leaf out of the NRL’s book on the treatment of women, as in a moral and logistic sense, it is setting the standard in how to deal with the question of players who are facing serious criminal charges.
 
 Speaking of elitist generalisations, there should be no attempt to pinpoint footballers as the sole or statistically – over-represented perpetrators of these kind of acts. The past month has shown that the upper ends of corporate Australia (dumped AMP senior executive Boe Pahari) and the academia (disgraced former Vice-Chancellor Peter Rathjen) are every bit as vulnerable to crappy treatment of women as are blokes who kick a footy for a living.
 
 The key question for our two biggest codes, when presented with the worst type of allegations, is how do they respond. In the NRL’s case they respond with immediate and unconditional force. In the AFL’s case they say a few serious-sounding things about how violence towards women cannot be tolerated, but then leave it up to the relevant club whether to take any action against a player or not.
 
 The AFL’s confused and weak leadership on this issue has been laid bare this week with the Sydney Swans taking the tough but right decision to stand down troubled youngster Elijah Taylor after he was charged with assaulting his girlfriend last Saturday, at the same time that Jordan de Goey is happily pulling on the boots for Collingwood every week despite being charged with sexual assault from an alleged incident in 2018.
 
 There is no logic that can explain this contradictory position, and the mixed messaging was made even worse by the AFL, which issued a thundering statement commending the Swans for sending strong signals about respect towards women.
 
 “Violence against women in any form is abhorrent and we strongly condemn it,” AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan said this week.
 
 “Our view is clear and unequivocal – violence against women is never okay in any circumstance – ever.
 
 “Our absolute commitment is to respect women and to never accept or condone in any way, shape or form violence against women.” They’re noble words but none of them counts for much while De Goey is still running around and heading into finals. He is a brilliant player, for sure, he won best on ground on Monday and his team is set for a finals berth. But the fact that the AFL is silent on his continued presence in the Collingwood team while at the same time lauding Sydney for rubbing out a fledgling 19-year-old only invites questions. It invites questions as to whether De Goey is getting different treatment because he’s a star player, or part of a club that is particularly influential in the upper echelons of AFL House.
 
 And here’s the weird thing. The AFL has a long track record of campaigning for social justice. It has often been accused of playing politics, such as when it lit up AFL House in rainbow colours for the marriage equality plebiscite, or advocating for the Recognise campaign to acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage in the preamble to the Constitution.
 
 While I support both those things, I find it baffling that on the fundamental question of violence towards women, it hasn’t got around to coming up with a policy.
 
 The one point McLachlan did make this week which explains their past trepidation was the need to ensure that people continue to be regarded as innocent until proven guilty. Sorry, but there are plenty of other fields of work where people would be automatically sacked for facing charges like these – and no-one is suggesting players should be sacked, rather stood down on full pay while charges are being heard.
 
 Doing nothing maintains a dangerous and unpleasant perception that charges like these are some kind of annoying inconvenience for the alleged perpetrator, as opposed to the woman on the receiving end of such abysmal treatment.

6,"FROM BLACK LIVES TO SPORT, WE’RE HIGH ON INEQUALITY",News,2021-04-04T19:45:48.918Z,"The scourge of illegal drugs is making it impossible to level the playing field
 
 You hear plenty about black lives mattering in the US, where blacks make up a significant proportion of the population. In Australia, where indigenous people are only 2-3 per cent of the population, you hear about their plight only sporadically. Pictures of a group of Aborigines drinking themselves into oblivion in a park somewhere in northern Australia occasionally will make the television news and give us food for thought for an hour or two, until we get back to living our normal lives.
 
  Kevin Rudd said sorry to them on our behalf, and that made us all feel as if we had done something worthy — but indigenous Australia needs more than just a few soothing words.
 
 What then remains is the hard part. We must now identify those needs and try to fill them. No one has managed to do this in my time in politics. It is why I told Bob Hawke that I would take any ministry except Aboriginal affairs.
 
 There is no more thankless task than that one. No one has been able to figure out how to alleviate poverty or drunkenness in indigenous communities, whether they be in towns such as Alice Springs or Halls Creek or on outstations in the bush. Noel Pearson is an inspirational leader and is an outstanding Australian. But once you go past him, the cupboard is pretty bare.
 
 While mention of it is frowned upon in polite circles, police know that when a group of young Aborigines come into town from an outer community, there will be a surge in car thefts and burglaries.
 
 Education is often touted as the way forward but school attendance is problematic and rates of absenteeism remain too high. ­ Disadvantage is rusted on to too many communities, and managing to escape it is not easy. Even 20 years ago in Katherine, there was a need for a safe house surrounded by barbed wire to protect women from their drunken husbands, who would beat them almost to death every pension day.
 
 Since those times, the drug ice has arrived and is posing another threat and more misery for people who are already doing it ­really tough. Ice is the perfect product for the outlaw motorcycle gangs producing this poison because it is the most addictive drug we have seen. The chemicals needed to produce it are easily sourced in China and the Chinese government seems to put up only token resistance to this trade. These days, apparently, among China’s bigger exports are the precursors to illegal drugs and a virus causing havoc all over the world.
 
 Experimenting with drugs has taken on a kind of rite of passage or mystique, but there is no glory to be found in joining in. My personal view on the relationship of drug-taking and law enforcement is that I would much prefer our police force to be out chasing rapists and murderers than bothering to hunt down cocaine users.
 
 When I was a senator, one of my parliamentary colleagues was a huge marijuana user. He had to be woken for some votes in the house. This drug can sap your work ethic and render you useless for all practical purposes. Its role in schizophrenia onset is well documented, so the idea that this is a benign drug is simply wrong.
 
 The production of performance-enhancing drugs goes ahead unabated, while trying to find these drugs and their masking agents is an industry in itself. The revelation that Lance Armstrong was not only using these drugs but controlling their distribution to other cyclists was quite a shock.
 
 My wife was an avid fan of the Tour de France but refuses to watch it since Armstrong’s antics were exposed. It reinforces how proud Australians should be of the great Cadel Evans, who competed successfully against his doped-up rivals for years.
 
 The East Germans were such a disgrace in virtually all the Olympic sports. My real worry there is that they injected so many young people with chemicals that had never been properly tested and the side effects of which were completely unknown.
 
 This desperate hunt for Olympic gold was not confined to East Germany. There were too many drug scandals in the US as well.
 
 The one athlete who can rightly claim she was robbed of a gold medal by cheats was our own sporting wonder Raelene Boyle. She was never given an even break. Our cyclists too have reason to complain because the East Germans against whom they competed were bulked up beyond belief on steroids.
 
 The need to win has created three new classes of chemist. One lot comes up with the drug. Then another lot comes up with the masking agent. Then comes the third lot, and their job is to eliminate the first two lots. These industries must have created some jobs. Maybe they can apply for loans under JobKeeper. Maybe they already have.",848
7,Hating women online - a refuge of scoundrels,Fairfax,2021-11-13T05:41:35.246Z,"When I started hosting a TV show I didn't expect that every day when I signed off and returned to my computer, there'd be a message from a bloke telling me which particular implement or technique he'd employ to anally rape me, but there it was. I have now grown so used to threats of violence I often forget to report them. To do so often seems only to be trimming leaves from a weed, or playing an unwinnable game of whack-a-mole.
 
 For others it's much, much worse. For women of colour particularly. Some men receive foul abuse, especially Indigenous and Muslim men, but for women it is particularly virulent and violent. And there is growing evidence such threats are increasingly being acted on offline. So why don't we take it more seriously?
 
 This week, a survey of international media workers released by the International Centre for Journalists and UNESCO found almost three in four women had experienced online abuse, harassment, threats and attacks. Crucially, one in five women had been abused and attacked offline, in ways ""they believe were connected with online violence they had experienced"". And evidence suggests this abuse has grown worse during the pandemic.
 
 Every time this happens to me, people tell me to get off social media. This is not the answer. Those scrotes will simply place another woman in the crosshairs.
 
 We need to stop telling women to ""grow a thicker skin"" and instead turn our attention to the murky underworld of misogyny online known as the ""manosphere"", which fuels and foments this violence.
 
 A chilling, important new book by British journalist Laura Bates, Men Who Hate Women: From Incels to Pickup Artists, the Truth about Extreme Misogyny and How it Affects Us All, is a potent call to start recognising how widespread and disturbing the manosphere is.
 
 She describes it as an interconnected spectrum of different but related groups, linked by misogyny, ""a vast spiderweb of sites, blogs, forums, chatrooms groups and social media accounts"", which young boys can easily ""blunder across ... and find themselves stuck, then [become] gently rolled closer and closer to its centre with smooth efficiency"".
 
 The manosphere is not abstract, she writes, but increasingly influential. Ideas about the need for rape to be tolerated, or legalised, a vast feminist conspiracy and the (false) claims about women lying about rape and domestic violence can be readily found on sites with many thousands of members and, she argues, are leaking into the mainstream in dangerous ways.
 
 After Bates began a project called EveryDay Sexism, for a decade men sent her daily messages, often in their hundreds, ""fantasising about my brutal rape and murder … letting me know which particular serial killers they'd particularly like to emulate as they end my life"". As she studied these groups, she began to realise the men in these communities were becoming increasingly effective propagandists. We can now see their rhetoric - with use of the same false statistics - repeated by politicians, or even school kids.
 
 Bates writes that in recent years she started hearing schoolboys ""who already felt that they'd been poisoned against the idea of even having a conversation about feminism"". They were saying extreme things: ""Feminism is a cancer, all women lie about rape, white men are the real victims of society.""
 
 In this context, violence is frequently normalised. I was shocked when a 12-year-old boy generally known as a nice kid sent my daughter a series of messages on Instagram saying he wanted to come around to her house and choke her to death. Twelve. Where does this come from?
 
 One thing that struck me reading this book is how fervently these online groups want to control women, and make rape acceptable. (The origin of the term ""incel"" is involuntary celibate - those unable to get women to sleep with them. Now incels argue legalising rape would make society fairer.)
 
 If they are ever closed down for airing these views, they pop up elsewhere. Blokes Advice, an Australian Facebook page - which had half a million members - was shut down for glorifying sexual violence in 2016. Two years later Reddit was forced to close a community of 40,000 after a user asked for advice on how to get away with rape. Books by ""pick-up artists"" read like rape manuals, providing techniques to circumvent a woman's refusal to consent.
 
 Even a cursory search of this writing reveals statements such as: ""Rape is essentially the act of ultimate validation and a rape accusation is the ultimate act of attention whoring …"" And: ""Telling a man 'no' is a way to weed out the weaklings from the men who know what they want (her).""
 
 MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way, a group that espouses ignoring women while remaining obsessed with them) and men's rights groups are also intently focused on false rape allegations, which they incorrectly see as prevalent. As Bates points out, a man in Britain is 230 times more likely to be raped himself than be falsely accused of rape.
 
 ""These are the kinds of attitudes,"" she writes, ""that many people would like to think were ousted decades ago. Yet here we see a whole new generation of men being drilled in techniques for mistreating women.""
 
 Some of this is now in plain view and even enabled by political leaders. On the day Donald Trump was elected President, TV cameras showed male university students in Sydney chanting ""grab her by the pussy"". Two of our female politicians, Emma Husar and Sarah Hanson-Young, have sat through court cases recently where lawyers argued about whether they were ""sluts"".
 
 Anyone who thinks this stuff does not have a tangible impact on women, and a chilling impact on their contribution to public life, does not understand the physical and psychological toll abuse can take.
 
 Before the British election last year, 19 female MPs stood down, several citing abuse as a reason for leaving.
 
 We need to stop viewing digital terror and abuse so casually, as an inevitable part of life. As we saw with the Christchurch killings, terrorists and murderers inhabit the manosphere too, often spouting misogynist garbage, beating wives or threatening rape before they go into temples or public places, killing indiscriminately.
 
 Bates has guts. It's ugly work, shining torches into dark places, dragging hate into the open air, exposing malevolence. But this hate will only prosper if we look away. Sunlight kills parasites.",1091
8,How to fill the tradie skills gap: women,Fairfax,2021-04-30T04:49:38.512Z,"While the uncertainties of COVID-19 wax and wane with every day of new information overload, one certainty is the closure of our borders to refugees and migrants for the foreseeable future, while interstate closures are also likely to be part of life.
 
 Border closures will come at great cost as immigration, the engine driving Australia's economic growth, will largely disappear for the medium term. Just how Australia will maintain its growth without being able to flog off apartments to migrants, without wealthy international families to maintain high-end property values, students to keep our rental markets buoyant, backpackers to harvest our fruit and other countries' university graduates to meet our skills shortages are now questions of great moment.
 
 Without tens of thousands of new workers pouring into the country every year, the need for new industrial arrangements to improve productivity has not been so great since the 1980s, which brought the Accord and enterprise bargaining.
 
 The skills shortage, which Australia has happily met with temporary skilled worker visas, now needs a different answer. The thought that Australia might lose its fruit and wine industries - because we relied on foreign backpacker pickers - should be too much to bear. Hard thinking is required.
 
 Increased automation has always been favoured as the answer to labour shortages. But it need not be and, with COVID-19 wreaking havoc in the labour market, now is the time for new answers to old problems.
 
 These might finally provide Australians with work suited to their abilities and circumstances and the opportunity to be the best they can be.
 
 To date, Australia has one of the most gender-segregated workforces in the developed world; COVID-19 could change that. Take the role of women in the technical workforce, the tradies who make stuff, fix things, build the country. The percentage of women in the construction and mining-related trades hovers about 3 per cent.
 
 Once you would have said this was the consequence of heavy equipment, but hydraulics and precision engineering have taken much of that load. The same goes for a swathe of other trades, including painting and decorating. Which Australian woman has not painted at least one room?
 
 It beggars belief we have been importing tradesmen, yes, men, when we have thousands of girls leaving school to enrol in TAFE or university courses with low job prospects or low pay and often which don't reflect their interests.
 
 Of course, there are fewer girls than boys interested in mechanical trades. But you can be sure there are more than we ever see in TAFE classes. The feedback from TAFE instructors, for your interest, tends to be that girls will often top these courses but not get the jobs.
 
 With governments focused on infrastructure investment to stave off mass employment and lift productivity, there should also be serious thought given to broadening the skilled worker opportunities for neglected sources of labour: women, Indigenous Australians and people with disabilities.
 
 It won't be as simple as offering more scholarships to women, Indigenous people or Australians with disabilities who want to be boilermakers. It will more likely require employers to review their work practices and ensure they are ready and able to take them on.
 
 It is not about strength, weight or height requirements. It's about culture. As sex-discrimination case law so clearly demonstrates, necessary changes are more than extra toilets. They include leadership, mentoring, conversations with the blokes on the tools and clear rules about unacceptable comments and conduct that are demonstrated from the top down.
 
 None of this should be beyond Australian governments, training bodies and employers; the difficulty of the task should not put them off.

 That indigenous Australians, who make up 3 per cent of this country’s population, account for 30 per cent of its prisoners is a national disgrace. That by the time they reach the age of 23, 75 per cent of young indigenous people in NSW will have been cautioned by police, referred to a youth justice conference or convicted of an offence in a criminal court — compared with just 17 per cent of their non-indigenous counterparts — makes the disgrace all the more searing.
 
 And the fact that just in the past five years nearly a quarter of the indigenous male population has been arrested and more than 10 per cent jailed, while one indigenous child in five has, at some stage, lost a parent to prison, raises that disgrace into an outrage.
 
 However, the worst of it is that the fault does not lie in the criminal justice system. After all, were these shocking outcomes due to racial bias, the path to a solution would be straightforward.
 
 But indigenous Australians are not imprisoned at such appalling rates because our system of law enforcement treats them unduly harshly.
 
 Rather, they are disproportionately represented in this country’s jails, and in the deaths that occur in those jails, because they are far more likely to commit violent offences. Nor is that seriously in dispute. On the contrary, as Don Weatherburn, perhaps Australia’s most eminent criminologist, concludes in a recent paper with Hamish Thorburn, “the overwhelming weight of evidence” confirms that “differences in rates of offending (and reoffending) account for most, if not all, of the difference in imprisonment rates” between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.
 
 And with indigenous women being nearly 40 times more likely to be hospitalised for intentionally inflicted violence than are Australian women generally, it is also beyond dispute that the harm those offenders inflict falls most grievously on indigenous Australians themselves.
 
 Yet none of that lets non-indigenous Australians off the hook. It was not indigenous Australians who destroyed thousands of Aboriginal jobs in country areas by suddenly raising the wages of cattle station labour in 1965; it was the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.
 
 Nor was it indigenous Australians who decided, just as the commission’s judgment was having its devastating effects, to massively subsidise remote Aboriginal settlements, condemning generation after generation to inadequate housing, an education scarcely worth having and a future shorn of jobs and hope; it was the Whitlam and Fraser governments.
 
 And it was not indigenous Australians who removed the prohibitions on the consumption of alcohol by, and the sale of alcohol to, Aboriginal people that had been in force throughout Australia since 1929.
 
 It was state and territory governments that, in keeping with the 1960s zeitgeist of self-determination, repealed those controls and decriminalised public drunkenness, plunging fraying Aboriginal communities into a spiral of alcohol-fuelled violence and helping to ensure that indigenous offenders are nearly three times more likely than non-indigenous offenders to be intoxicated when they commit their crimes.
 
 The result, as one Aboriginal community after the other succumbed to the epidemic of substance abuse, was that indigenous incarceration rates, which had been falling since World War I, began to soar.
 
 Far from slowing that rise, the explosive growth in welfare outlays that followed the onset of the crisis perpetuated the pathologies by allowing dysfunctional communities to survive. And instead of frankly confronting the root causes, successive governments relied on grandiose statements of good intentions and on torrents of cash in an increasingly futile attempt to paper over the cracks.
 
 Had the thousands of Australians who marched last week learned from that history and drawn its lessons, one could only have cheered them on.
 
 Of that, however, there was no sign. Epitomised by the participants’ slavish imitation of the ritual gesture of kneeling — which has clear resonance in America because of the prominence of the kneeling slave in the imagery of the abolitionist movement, but which lacks those associations in Australia — the rallies were copycat protests at which self-proclaimed representatives of indigenous people could vent imported rhetoric in tones of punitive hysteria.
 
 No doubt the slogan-mongering went down well with the crowd, many of whom had been chafing at the bit to return to protesting, regardless of the health risks that imposes on the community as a whole.
 
 And it would have been mother’s milk to the young Australians who had been taught since childhood that Europe’s expansion was a plague on the skin of the earth, that its civilisation was a monstrous imposture and that its arrival on these shores 2½ centuries ago heralded the destruction of a Garden of Eden.
 
 But demeaning the past does nothing to heal the present. Nor, for that matter, does setting ambi­tious targets that we do not know how to achieve, as the government seems intent on doing.
 
 Rather, what is needed is honesty and clear-sightedness. And the starting point must be to confront some uncomfortable realities. It is, to begin with, clear that much-touted nostrums, such as diverting juvenile offenders from the court system, have been tried and largely found to fail, with most studies concluding that they do not decrease the risk of reconviction, the time to reconviction, the seriousness of further offending or the number of reconvictions.
 
 And it is equally clear that while those approaches are not a viable solution, imprisonment does reduce the extent and incidence of serious offending, as well as shielding, at least for a time, the victims of violence from their tormentors.
 
 That hardly implies we should simply accept the dreadful costs mass incarceration imposes on indigenous Australians and on the moral fabric of the nation.
 
 What it does mean, however, is that we face an alternative. We can salve our conscience by retaining the unstated premise that has led to the current calamity: that indigenous Australians are essentially a separate race, who should be funded to live at enormous expense in places where there are no viable jobs, where supplying basic services is prohibitively costly and where alcohol and drugs are the only antidote to squalor, boredom and despair.
 
 If that is our choice, today’s pathologies, and the mass incarceration that is their symptom, will persist for decades to come.
 
 Or, while recognising the deep and enduring scars, we can reconsider the whole notion of racial separateness, reaffirm our commitment to the ideal of integration and begin the transition to a country whose principles, policies and ways of life are genuinely colourblind. The one thing we cannot do is pin the repeated failures on anyone but ourselves. They are a tragedy of our own making. And more than ever, they are our responsibility to repair.",1148
10,Indigenous women at high risk in crisis,Fairfax,2021-04-24T00:22:40.454Z,"The Australian government has promised a $1.1 billion health and domestic violence package to help protect vulnerable Australians during the COVID-19 crisis. But one of the most vulnerable groups of all, Aboriginal women and their children, may see little benefit at all.
 
 Recent cuts to critical Aboriginal family violence services mean support for Aboriginal women and children vulnerable to domestic violence was already going backwards before the government's latest promises. New restrictions and social distancing also pose a challenge to the Aboriginal community-controlled sector, community health, and social and family services that are relied on by Aboriginal women for family violence support.
 
 Aboriginal women and children are over-represented in all domestic and family violence statistics. Aboriginal women are 32 times as likely to be hospitalised because of family violence as non-Aboriginal women. Aboriginal children are seven times as likely to be the subject of substantiated child protection notifications, often due to family violence. These higher risks are exacerbated during times of crisis and high stress.
 
 Even without COVID-19 Aboriginal families face additional stressors such as overcrowded housing, inequitable healthcare access, trauma and racism. The psychological impact of lockdown measures will be significant.
 
 The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation mobilised early to protect Aboriginal communities from COVID-19 and has worked hard to establish with the government an emergency response management plan to ensure an adequate response to the virus and its broader health impacts.
 
 Recent advice from the Australian Indigenous Doctors Association suggests Aboriginal people continue to face racism in the health system when seeking COVID-19 testing and treatment. The child, family and social services sector has been less co-ordinated and there has been little to no specific response from the COAG Women's Safety Council regarding Aboriginal women's and children's safety during this time. The burden has once again fallen to the Aboriginal community-controlled sector, which is responding within its limited available resources.
 
 As remote Aboriginal communities close their borders and urban communities cope with lockdowns and move into crisis response mode, critical supports for Aboriginal women experiencing violence risk being either cut off or significantly reduced because of inadequate resourcing.
 
 Aboriginal women experiencing violence also rely heavily on their protective kinship relationships with other Aboriginal women. With social interaction limited to two people, COVID-19 measures will impact on the collective gatherings that Aboriginal women use for support.
 
 Governments must provide financial and workforce support to Aboriginal health, social and family violence services to develop culturally framed and safe mechanisms for Aboriginal women to seek the support they require. Social media and technology offers women some of the support they need and holds great potential in times such as these. This is one avenue of support for Aboriginal women if set up to support safety. Safe housing, legislation changes and community-based systems of reaching women and children while they are in lockdown are also critical.
 
 Listening to those working on the front line and across the sector is critical, as is listening to the voices of many Aboriginal women who are in desperate need of a government that responds to their needs.
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic shouldn't be remembered as the time during which governments failed to act and unprecedented numbers of Aboriginal women suffered at the hands of their violent partners or that the rates of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care soared even higher than the current alarming rate. Now is the time for governments to step up.

11,Retirees have a right to enjoy the roses,Fairfax,2021-09-21T21:50:03.076Z,"More than 100 years ago, female factory workers in Chicago campaigned for the right to vote and wondered how it could deliver them not only a ""living wage"" but life's roses.
 
 Their catchphrase, 'Bread for all and roses too' - with bread representing home, shelter and security and the roses representing music, education, nature and books - inspired generations of American women, particularly those involved in industrial action during the 1930s.
 
 The notion that the humblest workers have a right to live, not just exist, is as relevant today. Australia is one of the wealthiest nations on earth and we all deserve a share of the enormous economic gains of the past century. This includes retirees, many of whom struggle to make ends meet. It should be a central discussion point for the federal government's Retirement Income Review under way.
 
 There is no stated objective for our retirement income system in our law. However, the community has strong views on what the objective and features of our retirement income system should be.
 
 Research commissioned by Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees found more than eight in 10 Australians believe the government should ensure super and the age pension are set high enough so all Australians have a decent life, free of financial stress, in retirement. This finding is consistent across education levels, geographic location, and voting preference.
 
 Our polling suggests what most people want in retirement is no different to what the Chicago suffragettes wanted - to enjoy life, not just ""get by"". For most ordinary older Australians this means a weekly coffee and cake with friends, to afford home maintenance, the internet, a car or footy membership.
 
 In the lead-up to the Retirement Income Review, it's been suggested the government's legislated timeline to increase the compulsory super rate to 12 per cent by 2025 should be halted because the current super rate is enough. But the modelling by some researchers who reached this conclusion was based on a full-time male earning above median wages working continuously for 40 years. This is not the lived experience of a great many Australians - potentially more than half the working population. This includes women taking time out of paid work to care for children and family, low-income earners, those priced out of home ownership, many Indigenous Australians, single people and a large cohort who retire involuntarily due to ill health or the inability to find a job in later years.
 
 It has also been argued by some - including a group of Coalition MPs (who receive more than 14 per cent super) that low-income earners should be excluded from compulsory super and left to fend on the age pension. Meanwhile, the Save our Super lobby group, which also argues a super rate of 12 per cent is too high for people on low incomes, has called for the $1.6 million tax-free cap on pension accounts to be abolished or raised to boost retirement income for Australians with more than this in super.
 
 Despite the age pension being around since the early 1900s and compulsory super for three decades, we lack consensus on whether super is there to supplement or substitute the pension. But surely one thing we should all agree on is that in egalitarian Australia, all Australians have contributed to our nation's success and deserve a decent life when they lay down their tools.

12,Survival or death-by-stupid: your choice Straya,Fairfax,2021-11-14T04:42:02.515Z,"It's invasion day again only, this time, the eyes of the world are upon us. Under headlines like ""Australia shows us the road to hell"", the world is wondering if our economy isn't every bit as fragile as the landscape it routinely exploits. It's wondering about our tourism, with massive cancellations already from China and a US travel warning putting Australia on par with Gaza and PNG. It's asking how long Australia will be habitable. But beneath those questions lies another. What, at this crossroads, does it mean to be Australian?
 
 The first three are questions of both fact and perception. As such they may be partly addressed by Scott Morrison's $76 million commitment to beef up Australia as a brand. But the last is a question for us. Who are we, as a nation, and how do we wish to be going forward?
 
 As the fires rage on, bringing little but anti-green and pro-coal propaganda from our governments, we have a choice. We can go on pretending that exploitation is a sustainable way of life. We can pursue this culture of denial, where truths about nature, climate, women and Indigenous peoples are held in contempt. Or we can dust off our angel wings and smarten up.
 
 Australian culture has always relied on exploitation. From the moment white people arrived, we've been kidding ourselves that arrogance and theft add up to a lifestyle with a future. We dig stuff up and flog it. We grow food in the most destructive possible manner - clearfelling, monoculturing, irrigating and overgrazing; destroying soil, desertifying land and belching carbon. We crowd to the edge of the continent, gazing out to sea, chucking our trash over our shoulders, pretending it won't come back to bite.
 
 And sure, that's just colonialism. Colonialism is inherently macho, and inherently denialist. But it should be transitional. Now, as the NY Times argues, our political denialism is ""scarier than the fires"". Smarten up? It's time we grew up. This is Australia's moment of reckoning. It's time we lost the attitude. Time we made a clear, rational and collective choice between survival-by-respect and death-by-stupid.
 
 On Auckland's Maungakiekie, the volcanic Maori pa also known as One Tree Hill, stands an obelisk. The land was bequeathed to the city in the mid-19th century by the beloved Scot Sir John Logan Campbell, who designed the obelisk as a permanent record ""of his admiration for the achievements and character of the great Maori people"". That was then - now, New Zealand has Jacinda. And yes, these dots are connected.
 
 Australia has shown no such reverence. Indeed, unable even to express genuine remorse for our repeated attempts at genocide, we're still doing arrogant displacement. And we, as a result, have Scott Morrison, who must live with the epithet concocted by the Betoota Advocate - Scotty from marketing - because many believe it has a ring of truth. Morrison, who responds to bushfires by wanting to clear more land. Who thinks hazard reduction is climate action and more advertising can persuade them back to a charred land. Death-by-stupid.
 
 It's the arrogance we came with, two centuries back, and it's getting worse. Even now, our Indigenous peoples are being displaced three and four times over. Last year we extinguished native title for Adani's filthy foreign coal-mining interests, making the Wangan and Jagalingou people trespassers on their own land. We relentlessly export such coal, helping drive temperatures in central Australia beyond the habitable (Alice had 55 days above 40 degrees last year, and recorded street-surface temperatures between 61 and 68 - degrees), exiling people for a second time from their ancestral homelands. Then, should anyone dare critique this mindlessness, as Bruce Pascoe obliquely has, we label them non-Indigenous and set the federal police onto determining their ancestry. As if that very ancestry hadn't been, for two centuries, the subject of our energetic erasure. As if being Indigenous had always yielded some special right to speak, instead of the precise opposite. As if the speaker's genetic makeup validated or invalidated his speech. What?
 
 And we apply this domineering denialism, this refusal to listen, across the board. In agriculture it says we don't care what naturally grows here. We're going to poison the insects, suck the water from ancient caverns and nuke the living daylights out of the soil with petroleum-based fertilisers. We're going to burn oil and coal, and if we get fires that destroy our townships, we'll clear the forests too. That'll show them. In politics and at home it says, if our women are troublesome, we'll ridicule, intimidate and beat them into submission (with one woman murdered every week by her current or former partner and our political sphere internationally recognised for its misogyny).
 
 In sport, it says it's fine if our cricketers cheat - so long as they don't get caught. And in social relations, if people insist on different hierarchies - if they demand gender fluidity or same-sex marriage or voluntary race-identity or anything else that questions our superiority - we'll come down on them like a ton of bricks. God gave us white guys dominion and we've weaponised it. By golly, we'll show this country who's boss. Then if things get really rough, we'll pop to heaven.
 
 A recent street poster picturing Morrison declaring Pentecostals for a Warmer Planet! may seem extreme, but Emeritus Professor of Religious Thought, Philip C. Almond, explains why Morrison's faith means ""reducing carbon emissions ... may have little intellectual purchase with the PM"" - because world's end means the second coming and, for the chosen, salvation. It's also why Morrison's beloved Hillsong church can happily advertise its coming conference, called Breathe Again, with Bishop T. D. Jakes saying ""it's amazing how God can strike a match in Australia and the whole world catches on fire"". As if the fires were God given.
 
 That's choice A; Scott Morrison's choice. Business as usual but with extra cheesy advertising. Choice B, survival-by-respect, recognises that even cheese can't sell a pile of ash.
 
 Survival-by-respect means just that: respect for Indigenous people, for nature and women. It means knowing that listening is no weakness, but a path to greater strength. On the ground, the shift would be dramatic but not impossible. Zero carbon cities would become a priority: solar vehicles, every surface productive of food or energy. It would mean ending coal production. Investing in renewables. Creating new industries. This would mean listening to people who've spent 60,000 years here. Not copying, necessarily, listening. And listening, above all, to nature, heeding the fires' lesson. Forget the Aussie flag, the flag of dominion. This we should carve on our hearts: there is no economy without ecology.
 
 Sure, we can stick with lazy old Plan A. We can bow to Brand Australia and trust our grandchildren's futures to the Rapture Hypothesis. Good luck with that, and happy Straya Day!",1205

 In particular AFL – as our premier spectator sport – has an important role to lead from the front in tackling racism, championing Indigenous inclusion and fostering female participation, on and off the field.
 
 Tanya Hosch’s crowning as South Australian of the Year is worthy recognition of her stewardship of inclusion in the game and redressing years of inequality in the AFL and society more broadly.
 
 The AFL’s social inclusion and policy general manager has been a strong advocate for the rights of Indigenous Australians, criticising the AFL’s initial handling of the treatment meted out by fans to Sydney Swans star Adam Goodes.
 
 Her award is also testament to her body of work across business and the arts in advocating for the rights of Indigenous Australians and First Nation peoples.
 
 We congratulate Hosch and SA of the Year award recipients Professor Richard Bruggemann, Isobel Marshall and Russell Ebert OAM who are now finalists in the national awards with winners to be announced on Australia Day next year.
 
 What evidently unifies this quartet – and the other deserving award finalists – is a mission to use their skills and position to drive change in the lives of others and to make the world, in its simplest form, a better place.
 
 For Port Adelaide Football Club legend Ebert it’s trying to end violence against women, and for disability advocate, Bruggemann it’s to prevent a repeat of the horrendous death of Ann Marie Smith.
 
 Their stories and achievements can be used to inspire a society which is not driven by greed but a creed of selflessness.
 
 They are also a representation of the countless others in our society who are motivated not by reward but by giving back to their community, whether it’s by volunteering at a football club or feeding the homeless.

14,The benefits of gender equality are more than theoretical,Others,2021-03-19T01:43:34.124Z,"12,595,459.
 
 That's how many women and girls there were in Australia at the last population census update. There are more women than men in Australia, as in other developed countries - 197,569 more, to be precise.
 
 Given women make up slightly more than half the Australian population, and assuming our progress through life is the result of our own talents and effort, women should expect to occupy a roughly equal number of leadership positions in our parliaments, our business institutions, our civic and community institutions, on the sports field and in the home.
 
 Yet, just as in virtually every other society, there is very little in Australia that is shared equally between women and men. Across the life course, from infancy to old age, Australian girls and women struggle to access the same opportunities and rewards as Australian boys and men.
 
 Australia once led the world in the pursuit of gender equality and the rights of women - or, at least, white women. Australian suffragettes were among the most powerful and influential advocates for women in the world, and Australia was the fourth country in the world to enfranchise white women, which it did initially in the Colony of South Australia in 1894 and then nationally at Federation in 1902.
 
 The political and social empowerment of women changed the shape of Australia, but in recent years, Australia's progress towards gender equality has slowed dramatically.
 
 The shameful gap between the life chances of First Nations people and settler Australians is widely acknowledged, and although it is measured and reported on annually through the federal government's Closing the Gap initiative, progress to close it remains unacceptably slow. We know we are failing to close the gap for First Nations people because the machinery of government put in place to measure our performance tells us so.
 
 When it comes to the gender inequality gap, though, Australia no longer bothers to set targets or measure progress. In recent years, we have deliberately dismantled the institutions and indices that tracked our performance against the goal of achieving gender equality.
 
 International bodies, however, still produce data that reveals a disturbing picture of the relative wealth, safety, health and power of women in Australia.
 
 Per Capita's Measure for Measure: Gender Equality in Australia, released this month, assesses our performance against international indices, and demonstrates the risk to women's social and economic wellbeing due to gender inequality at particular points of life transition.
 
 Our research tracks the life cycle of Australian women, from early childhood through to education, employment, unpaid work, parenting, retirement and old age, and identifies the points at which they fall behind men in terms of their social and economic power. It investigates the impact of violence on women's security and wellbeing, the unequal treatment women receive in our health system, the way women are represented in our society, and how they fare in leadership roles.
 
 Throughout that cycle, gender inequality in Australia has a profound impact on women and girls: no area of a woman's life is immune to its influence.
 
 Gender inequality in Australia is a feminist issue and a matter of human rights protection, but it is also a barrier to Australia's economic growth and potential, with millions of undervalued women blocked from full participation in the Australian market because of cultural barriers to women's leadership and employment. First Nations women across the country suffer this more acutely on every measure, as do women with disabilities, migrant and refugee women, and those of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.
 
 Gender inequality is a drain on the public purse, with violence against women, particularly in the home, costing the economy billions of dollars. It is also a public health burden, with women experiencing poor health outcomes due to gendered bias in the provision of health care. And, of course, gender inequality reduces our collective wealth and economic growth, with women bearing a disproportionate burden of unpaid work.
 
 It is critical that our leaders recognise the reality and impact of gender inequality in Australia, and commit to a national, bipartisan approach to eliminating it. This requires regular monitoring and reporting against agreed targets, and the production of comprehensive data to track our progress towards a gender equal society.
 
 Ultimately, our goal must be an Australia in which women and girls are able to reach their full potential, and to live lives of equal opportunity to men and boys. Nothing less is good enough.

15,The time has come for a reckoning,Fairfax,2021-12-27T22:15:43.266Z,"One of the more perplexing arguments made in recent days is that toppling, relocating or removing old statues amounts to the erasure of history. It is in fact the very opposite: it is history. To seek a fuller understanding of the past is not wrecking, but restoring, salvaging and deepening history.
 
 History is not just a set of facts but a series of questions, a mode of inquiry that seeks to comprehend and put flesh on dates, events and places, to understand and include all possible perspectives, all while knowing that, until about 50 years ago, history was almost solely written by white men, about white men.
 
 This history was comprised of flawed, incomplete and often deceptive stories that not only excluded vital records, but were frequently used for propaganda purposes, and the buffering of myths like: all war is good, mighty and noble, if somewhat sad; the expansion of empire was jolly impressive; all important people sat in parliament or courts; and women and non-white people have not done particularly much of note for millennia.
 
 Why do people panic when this is pointed out? Why is it considered acceptable that a modern prime minister could actually assert ""there was no slavery in Australia""? When tens of thousands of Pacific Islanders were kidnapped or coerced to work as slave labourers on cotton and sugar plantations here, a practice known as ""blackbirding""? And First Nations people were forced to work unpaid on cattle stations, kept, wrote the chief protector in the Northern Territory in 1927, ""in a servitude that is nothing short of slavery""?
 
 These are not debates, but facts.
 
 We don't get to choose whether or not this happened; but we do get to choose whether or not we deny it. Or see it as somehow not significant.
 
 So the recent, ferocious challenging of public forms of history, I have to admit, has thrilled this historian's heart. I don't agree with all conclusions, and think a better understanding of context and acceptance of human limitation might temper some of our harsher judgments of remarkable but flawed figures, but overall, the revision is crucial.
 
 What has happened to statues - rolled into harbours, set aflame on their plinths, defaced with graffiti, hung with signs - is merely the
 
 visible form of what historians, buried in archives, wrestling with raw material, have been quietly doing to the myths of the past for decades, uncovering and tapping into computers - documenting a more complete account.
 
 The time for a public reckoning
 
 with the ongoing legacy of slavery,
 
 the horrors of colonial expansion, and the fact that we have not considered violence against people of colour,
 
 or women, to be of particular note,
 
 has come.
 
 Consider this fact: from 1870 to 1914, Europe went from having control of 10 per cent of Africa to 90. The horrors of those years are well known: loss of life, the brutal imposition of control, the plundering of resources: gold, diamonds, ivory.
 
 Which brings me to King Leopold II of Belgium, whose statue was set on fire then tipped over in Antwerp. This bloke was responsible for some of the greatest human rights abuses in history. Over the time he spent ruthlessly exploiting its ivory and rubber, when he somehow bought his way to become its ""sovereign"" - from 1865 to 1909 - the population of the Congo went from approximately 20 million to about 10 million. The first time the term ""crimes against humanity"" were used was for him. He forced local populations to work for him, regularly amputating hands as punishment and killed those who failed to meet his deadlines or pay the taxes that caused much starvation.
 
 Leopold II - who was Queen Victoria's cousin - was also just gross. He was a paedophile who paid £800 a month to have a steady stream of British virgins delivered to his abode in Belgium, having made clear his preference for young girls aged 10 to 15. When he was 67, he impregnated a teenage sex worker. He was so loathed by the end of his life that Belgians booed his funeral procession.
 
 So why does this matter? Because the ""history"" that was long taught to Belgian children was that of a great conquerer. A ""Great Forgetting"" occurred, and he was touted as the ""Builder King"" for his investment in public works. History, in other words, was erased.
 
 Now it is being restored. His statues have been vandalised for years.
 
 We need to stop thinking about history as a kind of binary ""positive"" or ""negative"", as either nice or bad, but as something that reflects all of the wild chaos, dark violence, and glorious triumphs of humanity; the story of all of us.
 
 Have we even moved on from
 
 the denialism of the ""black armband"" years? And if we don't accept the truth of history, can we ever move forward, and seriously address the gnawing, enduring racial inequality in
 
 this country?
 
 This reckoning also gives us a chance to be creative in our telling of history, as seen in the previous reworking of art acclaiming communists, eugenicists, fascists and dictators. As pointed out by ABC reporter Siobhan Heanue, after the statue of Emperor Augustus was captured by the Kushites it was decapitated and the head was buried under the steps of a new temple; all who climbed them were trampling it into the dust. The poetry is delicious.
 
 The Australian Catholic University's Associate Professor Nick Carter pointed out some others: a frieze that honours Mussolini in Bolzano, Italy, overlaid with Hannah Arendt's words: ""Nobody has the right to obey."" This forces us to remember, and reflect on how we remember. He also points to the work of artist Karyn Olivier who reworked African American and Native American figures in a 1934 University of Kentucky mural, and made a new one placing them in the centre.
 
 We could remove statues
 
 from plinths and place them at our height, or lower. We could place other figures around them, of the slaves they traded or controlled; show the massacres, the conflicts, the long hidden stories. We could create virtual reality resets, where you might look at a monument and its surrounds through the eyes of a slave, or soldier, a worker, or a maid. We could collect offensive statues and cluster them in museums where their stories would be fully told from myriad perspectives.
 
 Or we could grind them to dust and mix them with concrete, placing them on paths we walk on to a place, a country, where we not only accept the truth, but welcome it.

 Whether or not the document has been debated in the community, the problem shows in cases such as Pascoe v Hales, when Yolngu man Jackie Pascoe raped and held at gunpoint his 15-year-old “promised” wife. In Australian law, a girl of 15 is not of legal age to have sex, or marry. This is the law Yingiya has sworn an oath to uphold as a member of the Legislative Assembly.
 
 I too know my law and the culture I grew up in. As Aboriginal women, it is well understood that we could be killed if we trespass on sacred men’s ground.
 
 Senior women in my family have told me, in whispers, of the spearing of women by their husbands and of the executio­n of a teenage girl for refusing to go to a middle-aged promised husband who had alread­y killed a wife.
 
 All my life I have been taught to fear the law and that I could be killed if I broke it. All my life I have seen our women beaten, seen their wounds, visited them in hospital, been to their funerals.
 
 Perhaps you can forgive me for believing my own female elders. Perhaps you’ll forgive me for believing the law that terrifies women and allows for their rape, bashing and murder — in conjunct­ion with the other terrib­le problems of substance abuse, under-education and lack of employment — enables the epidemic of violence that is ­killing our women and girls.
 
 I am also deeply concerned about the fact that 23 per cent of Australian partner homicides are indigenous (despite us being only 3 per cent of the population) and that in the Northern Territ­ory 85 per cent of partner homicides are indigenous.
 
 Does the Australian law that states an underage girl cannot marry qualify as one of the “foreign­ solutions” Yingiya critic­ises? Can he honestly tell us the cultural laws no longer apply or are not resorted to in so many communities?
 
 Whitefellas continually change Australian law to make it work better. Yingiya is an MLA as my mother once was. He now has the opportunity to help make the law work better for all of us Territorians.
 
 All I’m asking is that we Aboriginal people take responsibility for our own law and be willing to keep what is precious and beautiful but abandon what no longer works and denies us our human rights as Australian citizens.
 
 Yes, we do need a conversation and I — and the other indige­nous people who share my concerns — want to be part of it. But it will not work unless everybody, women and young people as well, the victims of the violence, are allowed to have a say. Their voices must finally be heard.
 
 I doubt they will be speaking in support of cultural laws that enable — and excuse — the rapes, assaults and murders.Jacinta Nampijinpa Price is an Alice Springs councillor and director of indigenous research at the Centre for Independent Studies.",693
17,Toppling statues challenges history,Fairfax,2021-01-08T13:27:38.484Z,"One of the more perplexing arguments made in recent days is that toppling, relocating or removing old statues amounts to the erasure of history. It is in fact the very opposite: it is history. To seek a fuller understanding of the past is not wrecking, but restoring, salvaging and deepening history.
 
 History is not just a set of facts but a series of questions, a mode of inquiry that seeks to comprehend and put flesh on dates, events and places, to understand and include all possible perspectives, all while knowing that, until about 50 years ago, history was almost solely written by white men, about white men.
 
 This history was comprised of flawed, incomplete and often deceptive stories that not only excluded vital records, but were frequently used for propaganda purposes, and the buffering of myths like: all war is good, mighty and noble, if somewhat sad; the expansion of empire was jolly impressive; all important people sat in parliament or courts; and women and non-white people have not done particularly much of note for millennia.
 
 Why do people panic when this is pointed out? Why is it considered acceptable that a modern prime minister could actually assert ""there was no slavery in Australia""? When tens of thousands of Pacific Islanders were kidnapped or coerced to work as slave labourers on cotton and sugar plantations here, a practice known as ""blackbirding""? And First Nations people were forced to work unpaid on cattle stations, kept, wrote the Chief Protector in the Northern Territory in 1927, ""in a servitude that is nothing short of slavery""?
 
 These are not debates, but facts.
 
 We don't get to choose whether or not this happened; but we do get to choose whether or not we deny it. Or see it as somehow not significant.
 
 So the recent, ferocious challenging of public forms of history, I have to admit, has thrilled this historian's heart. I don't agree with all conclusions, and think a better understanding of context and acceptance of human limitation might temper some of our harsher judgments of remarkable but flawed figures, but overall, the revision is crucial.
 
 What has happened to statues - rolled into harbours, set aflame on their plinths, defaced with graffiti, hung with signs - is merely the visible form of what historians, buried in archives, wrestling with raw material, have been quietly doing to the myths of the past for decades, uncovering and tapping into computers - documenting a more complete account. The time for a public reckoning with the ongoing legacy of slavery, the horrors of colonial expansion, and the fact that we have not considered violence against people of colour, or women, to be of particular note, has come.
 
 We need to stop thinking about history as a kind of binary ""positive"" or ""negative"", as either nice or bad, but as something that reflects all of the wild chaos, dark violence, and glorious triumphs of humanity; the story of all of us.
 
 Have we even moved on from the denialism of the ""black armband"" years? And if we don't accept the truth of history, can we ever move forward, and seriously address the gnawing, enduring racial inequality in this country?
 
 We could remove statues from plinths and place them at our height, or lower. We could place other figures around them, of the slaves they traded or controlled; show the massacres, the conflicts, the long hidden stories. We could create virtual reality resets, where you might look at a monument and its surrounds through the eyes of a slave, or soldier, a worker, or a maid. We could collect offensive statues and cluster them in museums where their stories would be fully told from myriad perspectives.
 
 Or we could grind them to dust and mix them with concrete, placing them on paths we walk on to a place, a country, where we not only accept the truth, but welcome it.

18,Unheard voices become riotous roars,Fairfax,2020-09-04T17:41:57.715Z,"George Floyd's tragic death at the hands of Minneapolis police has drawn significant attention to police brutality against black people in America. Hashtags such as #Icantbreathe and #BlackLivesMatter have proliferated on social media.
 
 As an Australian who is a Fellow at Law for Black Lives in the US and is co-author of the Say Her Name report - which highlights police brutality against black women and girls in America - I have received numerous calls from Australian friends and colleagues asking what they can do about the situation. The answer may lie in our own backyard.
 
 As Indigenous Australians have been quick to point out, police brutality is sadly not unique to the US. In 2015, David Dungay Jr, a 25-year-old Dunghutti man, died in circumstances his family have described as ""strikingly similar"" to Floyd. Dungay spoke the same words as Floyd - ""I can't breathe"" - 12 times before losing consciousness and dying while being restrained by five prison guards in Long Bay jail hospital. Dungay's family sent a message of solidarity to protesters in the US, saying ""we feel their pain and stand with them"".
 
 There are undoubtedly differences between the police brutality experienced by black communities in America and Indigenous communities in Australia, owing to Indigenous peoples' unique status as original inhabitants and the history of colonisation, demographics, and America's gun culture, among other things. Nonetheless, as journalist and Darumbal/South Sea woman Amy McGuire recently said, ""our struggles are entwined and united"".
 
 What, then, can the American experience teach us about the work we need to do in our own nation to achieve reconciliation?
 
 In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. famously said ""a riot is the language of the unheard"".
 
 As an advocate of nonviolent action, King condemned the riots in America, while noting they were the direct consequence of America's failure to hear the plight of black Americans, to hear that promises of freedom and justice had not been met.
 
 King concluded: 'In a real sense, our nation's summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.""
 
 King's words resonate as America grapples with mass protests, some of which have become violent.
 
 Australia has not experienced violence similar to that seen in America - and it is extremely unlikely to do so. Nonetheless, King's message contains an important lesson: Indigenous voices must be heard in order to achieve reconciliation.
 
 Indigenous Australians have already eloquently articulated how we can do this. The day after Floyd's death marked the third anniversary of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, where 250 Indigenous leaders joined together to call for a First Nations Voice to Parliament.
 
 Despite the Morrison government's rejection of the proposal, an increasing number of Australians accept our First People's invitation to ""walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future"". The Voice has also attracted the support of a coalition of corporates, such as Qantas, BHP and PwC.
 
 This week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned that violent protests like those seen in America are not the answer.
 
 Fortunately, Indigenous Australians have told us what is. Now it is up to us to hear them.

19,Violence and death at end of long chain,Fairfax,2021-03-27T12:00:04.885Z,"Aboriginal people are too often the victims of racist and brutal policing. And yes, the way police treat Aboriginal children (and adults) needs to change. But getting rid of racist policing would do little to reduce the number of Aboriginal Australians in prison custody and the number who die there.
 
 Police treatment of Aboriginal people and Aboriginal over-representation in prison are two distinct issues requiring different responses. The former requires change in the behaviour of police. The latter requires an Aboriginal-led, government-supported effort to improve Indigenous outcomes in child welfare, health, education and employment.
 
 Sixty-three per cent of Aboriginal people in prison are there for violent offences. Primary victims are Aboriginal women and children. The violence is a product of a chain of events that starts with colonisation and dispossession and stretches forward in time through trauma, loss of purpose, child neglect, substance abuse, depression, poor school performance and unemployment.
 
 There should be no surprise in this. You can't invade a country, drive the inhabitants off their land, destroy their way of life, pass on your diseases, herd them into camps or on to islands, forcibly remove their children and expect no long-term adverse effects.
 
 Research at Harvard University has shown that slavery has done long-term damage to the economies of African countries from which slaves were taken.
 
 The fact the high rate of Aboriginal involvement in serious crime has its origins in the sequelae of colonisation and dispossession does not mean there is nothing we can do to reduce the rate of Aboriginal imprisonment or the number of Aboriginal people dying in custody.
 
 Aboriginal people are painfully aware many of their children are sliding off the rails and into drug use, crime and despair. They want it to stop. They want our support and assistance in stopping it.
 
 But it isn't going to stop if we do nothing more than reform the law and change police procedures.
 
 Real progress in reducing Aboriginal over-representation in custody will come only when we strengthen the hand of Aboriginal people who want to see their infants thrive, their children do well at school and those children get jobs when it is time to leave.

20,WEAK GLORIFIED IN OUR CULTURE,News,2020-10-29T17:49:46.325Z,"WHERE have all the strong people gone? Why are the hurt and bleeding now our new heroes?
 
 Once we admired people who kept a stiff upper lip. Now we demand they show us their wounds, and we ooh over their bandaged stumps and shattered feelings.
 
 Here are some examples from just yesterday’s papers.
 
 From an interview with Test captain Tim Paine: “Paine has revealed the depths of his mental anguish following a serious injury that left him unable to eat or sleep and embarrassed to leave his home.” The headline of a story on a star of the AFL women’s competition who was once called fat: “Moana Hope reveals footy fat shame horror.” The blurb to an interview with Julia Gillard, who became our prime minister but is celebrated for once complaining she was a victim of sexism: “Julia Gillard is amazed her gender speech still resonates.” Then there was this appeal from Victoria’s Aboriginal Affairs Minister to Aborigines to tell “the truths of our past” — but only the worst “truths” they could think of: “We owe it to Aboriginal Victorians to be frank and honest about the injustices they have faced.” And in the Sydney Morning Herald, Nick Bhasin, a former SBS culture editor, wept over feeling “weak” and “unvalued and unwelcome” at SBS, as well as “embarrassed and ashamed of my powerlessness”.
 
 See, this American-born man of Puerto Rican and Indian parents was upset SBS didn’t publicly shame an employee who’d told Bhasin that rudeness was part of Indian culture.
 
 These people now speak for a generation that makes a fetish of displaying its hurts and morbid sensitivities. Behold my tears!
 
 University students demand “safe spaces” where they will not hear opinions that challenge them, and “trigger warnings” in case they do.
 
 Mobs tear down statues that offend them, and agitate for the sacking of journalists, academics and writers who speak hard truths.
 
 Do not mistake me. I am all for pity. Pity distinguishes us from beasts and psychopaths. So does kindness.
 
 I am also no enemy of complaining — up to a point. Complaining is one way of getting change and the care you need.
 
 But there must be a balance, surely, between keeping everything bottled inside and showing your pain to get more attention than you deserve.
 
 “Don’t cry,” I was taught as a boy. Nobody likes a whinger.
 
 But now they do. How many of the above complaints would once — good or ill — have shamed the complainer?
 
 True, Paine talking about his setback may do someone good, but what’s this “horror”of being called fat?
 
 There’s a reason we were once told to “man up “ — the dated sexism of that phrase! — and to treat a body-blow as a scratch.
 
 Life is tough, and if we crumple at each bump we’ll get nowhere. What good comes from always focusing on our hurts? In trying to gain power by complaining, not creating? In admiring weakness over strength?
 
  Julia Gillard, for instance, would be more empowering if she was like Margaret Thatcher, pointing to what she’d achieved, rather than moaning about some slights — most exaggerated — she imagines she’d suffered.
 
 There’s one more reason to despise all this wound-waving.
 
 Everyone faces challenges, even if some face more than others. But now we see even the most privileged and pampered people advertise themselves as broken and insulted.
 
 Take Meghan Markle. She’s a successful actor, rich, celebrated and now living rent-free with husband Prince Harry in a $27 million mansion in Los Angeles.
 
 Compared with the vast majority of humans, Markle has no right to complain. She should not stand in front of cameras, lips quivering as she announces some private hurt. That just trivialises the real pain of the powerless.
 
 Yet Markle, of all people, is now the royal princess of this culture of complaint.
 
 The Greeks and Romans once taught stoicism as a philosophy, but Markle instead preaches wound-waving: “I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried, I really tried. But I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.” Harry is her convert. A former soldier who fought in Afghanistan and flew helicopters there, now babbles instead how he felt “very close to total breakdown on numerous occasions” in his life.
 
 Personally, I liked the old Harry better. But watch crowds of cripples shake their crutches in fury at anyone who says so.
 
 We’re all wounded now! The strong are weak! The weak are really strong! Oh, really?",775
21,Which team are you on with racism?,Fairfax,2020-05-02T18:17:36.715Z,"In rugby league, the success of a team comes down to what we are willing to do for each other. It's the same with tackling racism. I can make both claims from experience - as a former member of the Australian women's national league team, the Jillaroos, and as a Wiradjuri woman who chairs the Australian Rugby League Indigenous Council.
 
 Like many sports, rugby league brings people from all backgrounds together with a common purpose, building strong and vibrant communities. But the game does not simply exist inside the white lines and the 80 minutes on a Sunday afternoon, and neither do the challenges and successes of Indigenous people.
 
 This week, the NRL's Indigenous Round is celebrating the contribution Indigenous people make to the game and to our community more broadly, with the theme: ""Pass Back. Move Forward.""
 
 Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V'landys has described his shame - after meeting Indigenous players - at being unaware of the racism they have endured.
 
 Significantly, he has pledged that the game will tackle racism head-on. It will be an education process for the game, much as it needs to be for the nation.
 
 Almost all indicators of health and wellbeing in this country show the playing field is not level for Indigenous people.
 
 There are two paths we can take as a nation. We can continue with a system that has delivered inequity to certain racial groups, and at times this has been a deliberate strategy; or we can choose a path of ideas, policies and actions that lead to equality. The path that rejects racism.
 
 Tackling racism, especially systemic racism, requires a shift in thinking from blaming Indigenous people to understanding the history and context of how we got to this point.
 
 The place to start is truth-telling about our shared history.
 
 In your communities and workplaces, there are many ways for you to contribute to this team effort. We should all be asking: Do we even know how many Indigenous Australians are affected by the decisions we make? Too often policies and programs are designed with no or limited understanding of the people affected.
 
 In areas where Indigenous Australians experience much higher levels of disadvantage - health, justice, housing, education - the systems are woefully under-prepared and ill-informed about the number and location of those people affected. In football terms, we keep giving hospital passes and expecting the rest of the system to work it out on the run.
 
 We need to be building a habit of including Indigenous perspectives. Think about your book or music collections. Listen to news delivered by Indigenous Australians. Watch films and documentaries by Indigenous people.
 
 Make sure that when your child has an assignment on an Indigenous Australian you can name people, not only from our sports fields but across society and professions. They exist. There are many, but could you confidently name 10 to your children over dinner tonight?
 
 Throughout COVID-19, the NRL has done a great job of getting the competition back in action. The one thing we are all missing is the crowds at games, which understandably are still very restricted.
 
 But this absence has shown us the power of coming together, joining our voices to publicly show support for what matters to us.
 
 We need to find our voice in this same way in tackling racism. We see far too often how Indigenous people have been targeted for daring to raise issues of racism. It can make people uncomfortable. But so it should.
 
 You shouldn't be comfortable about the inequality endured by your fellow Australians. You shouldn't be silent. We need to see and hear your support - to know which team you're on.

22,A paedophile supporter gets OA award,Fairfax,2021-07-03T00:19:51.569Z,"The Order of Australia recognises Australians who have demonstrated outstanding service or exceptional achievement. Except when it doesn't.
 
 The decision to appoint Bettina Arndt a member of the Order of Australia for ""significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men"" demeans the awards and degrades the concept of rewarding those who work in the public interest.
 
 Worse, it makes clear these awards are not based on merit. The vote to give this recognition to Arndt was hotly debated but there needs be only a majority of one on the committee to bestow the award, according to multiple sources.
 
 Arndt's support of a convicted paedophile, maths teacher Nicolaas Bester, who sexually assaulted his student Grace Tame when she was 15, should have alarmed every single member of the Council for the Order of Australia.
 
 It certainly has alarmed other recipients. Ross Taylor, in 2013 appointed a member of the Order of Australia for his contribution to Indonesia-Australia relations, primary industry, transport and his cancer charity work, is horrified. His exact response? ""Devastated.""
 
 He knows the way in which society works against women. At a company where he was a board member, the chief executive refused to complain about her sexual abuse by a senior government official because if she did, ""I'll always be that bitch. I'll never work in this industry again.""
 
 ""I've seen first-hand what men are capable of,"" he says. ""The award should be directed at people who go beyond the income they get and beyond the normal work they do, and have made a significant difference to the betterment for our community. How does she meet that criterion?""
 
 Arndt says she took up the cause of men's rights because men get a raw deal. This has to be news to everyone except the tiny group of men's rights activists who spread misleading information in order to defame their partners. They relentlessly claim men experience domestic violence at a greater rate than women (no reputable study in Australia supports this) and that 21 men a week suicide because of family court matters (not measurable).
 
 There are a handful of such women, devoted to shoring up outmoded styles of masculinity, the heroic breadwinner, the strong and bountiful silverback, a model that constrains both men and women. Her attempts to derail the useful project of understanding what happens to sexual assault victims on campus are embarrassing. Survivors deserve support and help.
 
 As Rosie Batty said on Sunday: ""I cannot help but be appalled that someone who minimised violence towards women, who is part of the inevitable pushback and backlash that we all experience as we pioneer a way forward, would be awarded.""
 
 A committee makes the final decisions on these awards. Three years ago, I begged the government to change the committee and make it more diverse. Now it is nearly gender equal but not nearly diverse across a range of other factors, including political diversity.
 
 Let me just say, I'm not hopping on the bandwagon attacking awards to politicians such as Amanda Vanstone and Campbell Newman, although the absence of an award for Carmen Lawrence is inexplicable.
 
 For the past couple of years, I've been an ambassador for Honour A Woman, a campaign to get gender equity in the awards. It's doing much better than it did. But there are too many of the good folks missing out, the Helen Caldicotts, the Kate Eastmans, the Gillian Triggses, those who really have been outstanding servants of our nation, not those on a trail of self-promotion and attention-seeking.

23,Action on ambulance claims took far too long,Fairfax,2019-12-31T21:26:18.668Z,"The Age's View
 
 It was November 2014, and then Victorian Police chief commissioner Ken Lay sent out a video message to every officer, making his views clear: ""There are some men in this organisation whose behaviour towards women is reprehensible. It is based on a sense of entitlement by some men, who think it's OK to sexually harass, intimidate, and degrade women. The behaviour is simply unacceptable and has no relationship to our sworn duty to uphold the right.""
 
 He backed up his words by calling in the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission to investigate. A year later, a damning report found an ""entrenched culture of 'everyday sexism' coupled with a high tolerance for sexual harassment"".
 
 The review led to reforms that continue to this day. A recent report revealed that a scheme set up to support police officers who had been sexually harassed, assaulted or discriminated against at work had been inundated with victims seeking compensation and counselling.
 
 For personal reasons, Mr Lay resigned as chief commissioner soon after he triggered the review, but the following year he was made chair of Ambulance Victoria. On his appointment, he said it was an organisation that needed to move with the times: ""We need to continue to modernise, we need to continue to get better and reshape the organisation.""
 
 This week, The Age reported claims that within Ambulance Victoria there exists a culture of widespread discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying of female paramedics. Rasa Piggott, an advanced life-support paramedic, wrote an open letter to Mr Lay laying out her concerns.
 
 One paramedic said she had witnessed a female colleague being sexually harassed by a male colleague while the woman was giving cardiac compression to a dying patient. Several others reported an incident in which a young first responder travelling with a manager in a remote region was told he could ""tie you to a tree and rape you"".
 
 These are not just one-offs. A large number of women and men have come forward to The Age saying that these types of incidents are widespread in the state's 4000-strong ambulance service. And let's be clear: these are not incidents from ""the bad old days""; this culture is alleged to be rife today.
 
 In response, Ambulance Victoria chief executive Tony Walker and Mr Lay met Human Rights Commissioner Kristen Hilton to ask her to kick off an independent inquiry.
 
 While this is welcome news, considering Mr Lay's experience at Victoria Police, how could such an alleged toxic culture exist at Ambulance Victoria for so long under his watch without stronger action to stamp it out?
 
 The same goes for Mr Walker, who was appointed chief executive in 2016. In response to the allegations this week, he said: ""I want to be very clear that these behaviours and actions have no place in the Ambulance Victoria I lead. They will simply not be tolerated. Today this stops.""
 
 Strong words, and an echo of what Mr Lay said in 2014 when first confronted with similar allegations at Victoria Police. But how can this be a surprise to such experienced managers? Calling for an inquiry is not enough.
 
 Surely the public deserves some explanation as to why such allegations have taken so long to surface and be investigated by an independent body in a transparent way. Anything less was never going to get the job done. It's time Mr Lay and Mr Taylor held themselves to account for not having the proper internal systems in place to quash this abhorrent culture earlier.",607
24,Albanese’s budget speech blues far from in the pink,News,2021-12-03T16:02:45.287Z,"Labor would increase the government’s economic footprint Almost 50 years ago, the Whitlam government’s progressive policies of providing maternity leave, equal pay and removing discrimination against women in the federal public service left the Coalition looking out of touch and old-fashioned. The worm has turned. Women, Anthony Albanese said in his budget reply speech on Thursday night, were at the heart of Labor’s plan to “kickstart the economy and get Australians back to work”. Then followed the opposition’s extravagant childcare pitch, aimed at introducing a 90 per cent subsidy for all families. It would leave some up to $2900 a year better off. “In the worst recession for 100 years we have to make sure women aren’t forced to choose between their families and their jobs,” the Opposition Leader said. The plan would suit potential beneficiaries but leave most taxpayers shouldering a heavy burden.
 
  And its narrow focus is no strategy for rebuilding an economy ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The days of pitching to women as an enfeebled, disadvantaged minority are long gone. Labor’s quaint critique of the Morrison government, that “we can’t have a pink recession and a blue recovery”, is an anachronism. Even more pathetic was Mr Albanese’s line in the budget reply speech: “Women have suffered most during the pandemic but are reduced to a footnote. The best the government can offer is they can drive on a road.” Huh? As Scott Morrison “mansplained” in question time on Wednesday: “It may come as some surprise to the Leader of the Opposition but women run small businesses … Women pay tax. Women hire other Australians in their businesses.” As well as wanting safe roads, the Prime Minister said, women “want to go to university, and they want to study science and technology and engineering and maths, like the Industry Minister did. They want to get apprenticeships. They want to get traineeships. They want to get jobs”. Mr Albanese’s implicit suggestion that women have nothing to gain from Josh Frydenberg’s budget strategy of enhancing conditions for private sector investment, growth and job creation harks back to the working world of our grandparents.
 
 While claiming, falsely, that “the only legacy of the budget is trillion-dollar debt”, Mr Albanese did not critique the Treasurer’s business strategy directly. And he shares the government’s concerns about the importance of skills training, pointing to the shortages of nurses, welders, bricklayers, engineers and hairdressers. With several years of negative net migration ahead, redressing those shortages will be vital to growth. Our nation has been built and strengthened on various waves of skilled immigration. Sooner rather than later the pattern will need to resume. A considered, updated strategy of Peter Costello’s “one for Mum, one for Dad and one for the country” might not go amiss either, given the challenges created by our ageing population.
 
 The speech showed Mr Albanese would not be averse to venturing down the path of “picking winners” with taxpayers’ money and increasing government interference in the productive economy. In an ideal world, the $270bn worth of defence spending on the books should open the way for developing our sovereign industrial and research capabilities and build skills and building expertise within the Australian workforce, as Mr Albanese said. Improving the nation’s defence preparedness, however, must never be used as a “make-work scheme”. That error has been made before by both sides of politics.
 
 Mr Albanese’s vision for a national rail manufacturing plan may or may not stand scrutiny. He wants a national audit of passenger train capacity and condition, to develop a rail procurement and manufacturing strategy and to assess how the sphere can go about fostering jobs, research and development and export opportunities. The starting point would need to be a thorough cost-benefit analysis. If Australia, under either side of politics, is to expand manufacturing, a modernised, flexible industrial relations system and an energy policy that allows companies access to cheap power will be fundamental to success. Mr Albanese’s lament over the demise of the car industry in Australia was conveniently selective. The price of propping it up was vast. The nation would venture down the old-fashioned protectionist path again at our peril.
 
 Mr Albanese’s call for the repair of social housing, which is badly run down in many areas, is a good one. And the states, which are responsible for social housing, should get on with it, boosting tradies’ order books, demand for labourers and apprentices and new tools and equipment. The states would need to weigh up Mr Albanese’s call for 200,000 new public housing dwellings to be built, with a view to its impact on the property market. His pledge of an Australian Centre for Disease Control makes sense, provided it would not duplicate existing research efforts. While attempting to deride the government’s projected debt levels, Mr Albanese’s alternative policies would increase, not diminish, public sector interference in the economy. He also was notably quiet on tax policy. Like Bill Shorten last year, his vision offered little reward for enterprise and effort but more “government knows best”. Labor needs to rediscover the power of aspiration and incentive.",887
25,All areas of sport need more women,Fairfax,2021-10-31T15:18:05.748Z,"I once said ""I want to be the CEO of a football club"". At the time, I knew of only one woman who was the managing director of a football club - Baroness Karren Rita Brady at Birmingham City FC.
 
 That was almost 20 years ago. Then, and even today, it could have been perceived as the impossible dream. In Australia, women in leadership in sport is still the exception, not the rule.
 
 Research released by Sport Australia in 2019 shows women are under-represented in organised sport - as participants, coaches, officials, administrators and board members.
 
 Across 63 national sporting organisations , only 24 per cent of CEOs are women. An even greater disparity exists for high-performance coaches - only 15 per cent are female.
 
 The good news is we know what we can do to address this gender imbalance - we just need workplaces to step up and break down the structural barriers in our sporting system.
 
 I was the first female CEO in men's professional A-league football in Australia when appointed to the position of CEO of Perth Glory FC in 2005.
 
 The circumstances that led to this were unusual. When I was 31 and holidaying in Tanzania, my tour truck was held up by armed men. The extraordinarily violent incident was a catalyst that forced me to reassess my life. By the end of 2004, I was back in Australia as CEO of Football West and soon after appointed to Perth Glory.
 
 I've always been passionate about women in sport and grew up believing girls were just as capable as boys in their ability to play and lead. But as with any male-dominated industry or profession, it's about having opportunities to demonstrate your skills and a culture that recognises the value of diversity.
 
 Today, I'm the CEO of YWCA Australia, a proud national feminist organisation focused on improving gender equality for women, young women and girls. For 140 years, we have challenged the systems, structures and policies that have blocked women, especially young women, achieving their full potential.
 
 The feminist leadership work we do may seem a world away from the sporting world I used to be in, but there are key commonalities. Both have the same results when done well with diverse representation on all levels - they secure self-confidence, encourage community cohesion and have a positive impact on overall health.
 
 A variety of strategies exist to help deal with gender bias and equalise leadership opportunities for women across sporting codes.When young women dream about being the CEO of a football club, they shouldn't instantly think that statistics are stacked against them. They should think ""I can do this"".As a starting point, workplaces need to recognise the key role they play in creating gender equitable communities and put strategies in place to support this. For change to happen, current leaders need to be ready to talk about gender inequality, be open to doing things differently and be committed to taking action to build equitable and fairer workplaces.
 
 Staff need to be supported with measures to build their skills and confidence in creating gender equity through training, information sessions and events, resources and communication.
 
 And organisations should start embedding gender equity into their operations by applying a gender lens to strategic planning and organisational policies, reviewing flexible work practices, creating mentoring programs and starting a staff-led gender equity committee.
 
 Integrating gender equity principles into workplaces makes economic and business sense and can be easily achieved with the right tools, support and commitment. The pandemic has already created significant change to the way many of us work. Now is the perfect time to commit to gender equity in our workplaces.

26,Ardern's catch of the day: her partner's support,Fairfax,2021-03-11T13:53:15.061Z,"I have excellent advice for young women at university who see a career in politics ahead of them.
 
 A single woman in search of a seat in Parliament should find herself a househusband. Or equivalent. Do not be distracted by alpha males who want to be chief executives or what US author Michael Lewis termed the Big Swinging Dicks. Especially, avoid those who want to get rich quick or those with burdensome egos.
 
 Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a pillar of support. Someone who will be happy to pick the kids up after school, make delicious fish sliders in a hurry, campaign by your side with the enthusiasm of Hazel Hawke.
 
 Jacinda Ardern did not meet Clarke Gayford at university. But her choice of partner made it possible to concentrate on her work uninterrupted. She met a man who was happy to play second fiddle on the political stage while playing first violin to their two-year-old daughter, Neve. He has never once let the story be about him, although stories do appear when Gayford prepares food for reporters waiting at press conferences. For those who don't know, Gayford has a massively successful TV show, Fish of the Day, but his main gig is Neve.
 
 That humility is unusual behaviour in a man and I say that lovingly. Men are brought up to believe they are masters of the universe, able to conjure up money and fame by virtue of their self-identified talent.
 
 Women in political life downplay their partners for obvious reasons. The disruption of the old order scares the old order. As ANU academic Blair Williams puts it, ""Women don't want to be seen to be emasculating their partners."" Williams reminds me of the belting Julia Gillard got for her hairdresser handbag and her childlessness.
 
 ""Male politicians use their families to be seen as more relatable and affable to the electorate but it doesn't work for women,"" she says. ""But Jacinda appears to be bucking the trend.""
 
 Jennifer Curtin, New Zealand's leading researcher on gender and political leadership, says Ardern's comprehensive flogging of the Nationals has delivered nearly equal representation in Parliament and the new Labour caucus has 55 per cent women. Labour can govern alone and that will increase pressure on Ardern to promote more women into cabinet.
 
 Australia can learn from Ardern. When more women stand, with partners standing by them, our Parliament will be forced to change its practices. Current parliamentary and party practices privilege men who have stay-at-home partners and, even worse, those men rarely understand the impact of the laws they pass on the majority of the population: women.
 
 Witness the budget if you want an example of a document designed by men and cheer-led by women, who say of course it is an inclusive budget because women drive on roads.
 
 How about politicians taking the advice of the National Foundation for Australian Women? Researcher Janine Dixon of Victoria University says: ""An increase in expenditure on care services delivers clear economic benefits and helps to alleviate female economic disadvantage. Spending on care services delivers a double dividend: of job creation in the care sector, and positive labour supply impacts for over 900,000 Australians who perform unpaid work caring for the elderly, disabled and children. More than 70 per cent of the labour supply impact benefits women.""
 
 Shame our politicians left that out of the budget. There's one way to fix that. Women, stand for Parliament. Bring your partner with you.

27,Arndt's Order of Australia demeans the awards,Fairfax,2021-06-07T08:17:04.692Z,"The Order of Australia recognises Australians who have demonstrated outstanding service or exceptional achievement. Except when it doesn't.
 
 The decision to appoint Bettina Arndt a member of the Order of Australia for ""significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men"" demeans the awards and degrades the concept of rewarding those who work in the public interest. Worse, it makes clear these awards are not based on merit. The vote to give this recognition to Arndt was both close and hotly debated, but there needs to be only a majority of one on the committee to bestow the award, according to multiple sources. Usually, the committee tries for consensus.
 
 Arndt's support of a convicted paedophile, maths teacher Nicolaas Bester, who sexually assaulted his student Grace Tame when she was 15, should have alarmed every single member of the Council for the Order of Australia.
 
 It certainly has alarmed a few other recipients. Ross Taylor, in 2013 appointed a member of the Order of Australia for his contribution to Indonesia-Australia relations, primary industry, transport and his cancer charity work, is horrified. His exact response?
 
 ""Devastated.""
 
 Arndt says she took up the cause of men's rights because men get a raw deal. This has to be news to everyone else except the tiny group of men's rights activists who spread misleading information in order to defame their current or former partners. They relentlessly claim men experience domestic violence at a greater rate than women (there is no reputable study in Australia that supports this) and that 21 men a week suicide because of Family Court matters (not measurable).
 
 There are a handful of such women, devoted to shoring up outmoded styles of masculinity, the heroic breadwinner, the strong and bountiful silverback, a model that constrains both men and women. Back in the day when Arndt was a sex therapist and editor of Forum, she devoted many column centimetres to the way in which men could be better lovers. Tom Durkin, one of her contributors, said men are ""basically in competition with all other men ... he cannot nurture himself because this behaviour is seen as weak and inappropriate to the male role"" (Forum's Guide to Sexual Growth, 1977, page 88 and, of course, I still have my copy). Arndt knew then that men were suffering because of stereotypes of masculinity, ones she now supports.
 
 As Rosie Batty said on Sunday: ""I cannot help but be appalled that someone who minimised violence towards women, who is part of the inevitable pushback and backlash that we all experience as we pioneer a way forward, would be awarded.""
 
 A committee makes the final decisions on these awards. Three years ago, I begged the government to change the committee and make it more diverse. Now it is nearly gender equal but not nearly diverse across a range of other factors, including political diversity.
 
 There is one representative from each state and territory, appointed by state and territory governments. Let me just say, I'm not hopping on the bandwagon attacking awards to politicians, although the absence of an award for Carmen Lawrence is inexplicable: politicians do get paid for their public service but the good ones go well beyond. It is an unpleasant life being a politician, as former Queensland premier Campbell Newman would know, dumped after a brief tenure and unable to convince voters he knew what he was doing. (Reader, he didn't.) For the past couple of years, I've been an ambassador for Honour A Woman, a campaign to get gender equity in the awards. It's doing much better than it did - and in Victoria, which has a dedicated team devoted to nominating women, the numbers are nearly at parity.
 
 But there are too many good folks missing out, the Helen Caldicotts, the Kate Eastmans, the Gillian Triggses, those who really have been outstanding servants of our nation, not those on a trail of self-promotion and attention-seeking.

28,Be alert and alarmed about boys' role models,Fairfax,2021-01-04T16:32:07.952Z,"As Australia confronts violence against women, Amanda Wilson writes of her son's distressing encounter this week.
 
 I am very fortunate to be the mother of twins, a boy and girl who attend a co-educational school in Sydney. I received a phone call from the school on Wednesday to say there had been an incident while they were at camp.
 
 A few boys had told my son they thought his sister was cute and wanted to ask her out. These are 12-year-olds, mind you. Another boy later approached my son and said words to the effect: ""I like your sister and I'm going to rape her."" My son's horror to hear these words - the rage and hurt he felt - were enormous.
 
 I commend the school for the way it promptly handled the situation. After discussions with teachers, it emerged the boy who made the remark did not know the meaning or connotation of the word ""rape"". Who knows where he had heard it? Video games, social media, TV? Perhaps he overheard conversations at home.
 
 My children are so lucky to be at a school that cares and doesn't take these situations lightly. It so happens, however, that their terrible experience coincided with the entire nation stopping to ask hard questions about the way some men treat women - and, with it, how we are influencing our boys to regard and treat girls. It happened in the same week the Federal Parliament stopped to pay tribute to Hannah Clarke and her three children, all so horrifically murdered in Brisbane in an act of domestic violence.
 
 We are becoming increasingly aware of a grim statistic: about one woman is killed each week in Australia by an intimate partner or ex-partner. Now women and men across the nation want answers. Why? More importantly, what are we doing about it?
 
 If terrorism claimed the life of one Australian every week, the government would be throwing vast amounts of funding at securing the nation and its borders. Yet this terror called domestic violence exists in every city, suburb and town. As a society, we need indeed to be alert and very alarmed.
 
 We must work to guide our children to respect each other, and teach our sons to call out disrespectful behaviour towards girls.
 
 At our school, support for the wellbeing and safety of my children has been paramount and I am proud of the maturity and resilience they have shown. Of equal importance to our family and the school is the counselling, nurturing and wellbeing of the child who made the comment.
 
 But more broadly, our government must be at the front and centre of this discussion and of change. Pauline Hanson, unquestionably, should not be involved as deputy chairman for the inquiry into the family law system, given her appalling remarks following the Brisbane atrocity - that ""a lot of people are driven to this, to do these acts for one reason or another"".
 
 We need increased funding for programs to help women and children leave violent men, more refuges, more domestic violence officers in state and territory police forces, stricter enforcement of violence orders, education and anger-management courses for men, and support for both men
 
 and women when relationships break down.
 
 And little eyes watch and little ears are listening to how male politicians behave. If our male political leaders cannot treat women with respect, how will our boys and young men learn to act towards women?

29,Bettina Arndt should return Order of Australia,Fairfax,2021-04-25T07:49:11.378Z,"There's far more tied up with the destiny of Bettina Arndt's Order of Australia medal than just the question of, ""If someone says something many find deeply offensive, should recognition for everything else they've done be cancelled?"" This is not about free speech. If Arndt keeps an award that sets her values and standards apart as exceptional, this is a reflection of who we are.
 
 The real guts of this question is this: do we value the right of women and children to be safe from acts of violence, with no exceptions or qualifications, or are we happy to have that casually dismissed?
 
 Arndt makes her living from her opinions, and those she has had published and broadcast advocating for men's gender equality are the service to the community that attracted the Order of Australia.
 
 Her typical line on men being the real victims, which often involves her being inexplicably harsh on her own gender, has become so familiar as to be predictable. Her provocative, often ""anti-feminist"" tweets are clockwork-reliable when any culture war is brewing from which her brand could receive a puff of oxygen.
 
 Like so much Twitter bluster, you learn to ignore most of it, or at least hesitate to engage with it on the grounds it will only prolong a moment in the spotlight for someone attempting to merchandise outrage about easy targets for her audience, such as alleged fabrication of family violence claims by women or alleged exaggeration of the incidence of sexual assault (despite hard stats on both).
 
 The fact Arndt gave a platform to convicted paedophile Nicolaas Bester and was still deemed worthy of national recognition was astounding enough for the tacit endorsement it appeared to give to hearing ""the other side"" from child abusers.
 
 But her latest effort, cheering on comments by a policeman who raised the possibility a man who burned his estranged wife and three kids to death may have been ""driven too far ... by issues or circumstances"" - so, in some warped world it may be understandable - is so irresponsible as to put vulnerable women and children at even greater risk.
 
 Queensland Detective Inspector Mark Thompson (who has since stepped aside from the investigation into the murders of Hannah Clarke, 31 and her children Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4, and Trey, 3) told a press conference that investigators needed to keep an ""open mind"" about what happened to the mother and children.
 
 He said: ""There are probably people out there in the community that are deciding which side, so to speak, to take in this investigation. Is this an issue of a woman suffering significant domestic violence, and her and her children perishing at the hands of the husband? Or is it an instance of a husband being driven too far by issues that he's suffered by certain circumstances into committing acts of this form?""
 
 Arndt rushed to social media to praise his comments, saying, ""Congratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 'driven too far'. But note the misplaced outrage. How dare police deviate from the feminist script of seeking excuses.""
 
 To suggest it's a good idea to question if Rowan Baxter had underlying reasons that made mass murder somehow something less goes beyond contrarian resistance against joining the rest of the nation in its shock, grief and fury. The comments not only showed no sensitivity to the vast number of violence survivors and those still living in terror. They arm offenders and potential offenders with an excuse.
 
 If those we single out for prestigious awards indicates the actions and values we hold high, then Arndt's enthusiasm for comments that potentially water down culpability for this foul crime demonstrates we are a society that sees grey areas around the idea women and children deserve to be safe from violence, full stop.
 
 Arndt's Order of Australia is under formal review. If she really wants us to believe she is for equality of both genders, she should hand it back.

30,Bill is likely to backfire on Christians,Fairfax,2021-10-10T08:52:23.304Z,"Conservative Christians are some of the biggest supporters of Scott Morrison's religious discrimination bill. But they should be careful what they wish for. It won't just be gay people, people with disabilities and women who lose out under the proposed law. Christians will be among the biggest losers.
 
 The bill protects ""statements of belief"" from being the subject of a complaint under any federal, state or territory anti-discrimination law.
 
 The protection extends to statements made in writing or by spoken words that ridicule, humiliate or even intimidate another person. Employers will be able to ridicule Christians in the workplace. Doctors will be able to humiliate Christian patients. For example, a Buddhist doctor could tell the Christian parents of an unwell child, ""If you spent less time praying and more time caring about your child's health, your child wouldn't be this sick.""
 
 Shopkeepers will be able to intimidate Christian customers.
 
 Under existing anti-discrimination laws in most states and territories these examples would likely be unlawful discrimination. Scott Morrison's religious discrimination bill changes this. The bill overrides state and territory laws and makes being nasty to Christians lawful. The bill also includes a mechanism to allow a federal minister to override any other federal, state or territory laws, such as work health and safety laws, that might prevent people making ""statements of belief"" like these.
 
 The bill also harms Christians in other ways. The bill attempts to prevent Christians being discriminated against on the basis of their beliefs in hiring and firing decisions. Bosses can use ""statements of belief"" to be nasty to Christians, but technically won't be allowed to refuse to hire them.
 
 What matters is real life. In practice, the bill actually encourages employers to refuse to hire Christians.
 
 The bill includes provisions that allow Christians to ignore workplace codes of conduct in certain circumstances. For example, Christian workers will not have to comply with some workplace codes of conduct that prohibit making comments on social media like those made by Israel Folau.
 
 The reality is that many businesses take such codes of conduct seriously. Under Morrison's religious discrimination bill, life will be easier for businesses if they simply do not hire Christians. That would avoid all the hassles, all the commercial impacts and the expensive legal fees involved in Christians not having to comply with workplace codes of conduct. Of course, technically it will be unlawful to refuse to hire someone because they are a Christian. But the Christian has to prove that the reason they didn't get the job was because they are a Christian.
 
 Actually proving that was the reason is extremely hard to do. And it is expensive, usually involving lawyers. On the other hand, it is very easy for an employer to say that someone didn't get a job because of a poor interview performance.
 
 The religious discrimination bill was supposed to be a consolation prize for conservative Christians unhappy with the law allowing same-sex marriage. But Scott Morrison and Attorney-General Christian Porter have stuffed up big time. The religious discrimination bill backfires, giving everyone else a right to be nasty to Christians.

 Jade Allen escaped a lifetime of violence to forge her own path.
 
 Jade Allen has no right to be here. She should be dead - just another kid born into a living hell who didn't have a chance. Addicted to drugs from birth due to her mother's heroin abuse, she was only days old and still critically ill when abducted from hospital by her father, a notorious drug trafficker and multiple murderer.
 
 ""I was very sick when Dad came and just stole me from the special care ward. No one had the guts to try and stop him,"" she says.
 
 Her dad was the notorious Dennis Bruce ""Mr Death"" Allen. Kath Pettingill, Allen's mother, recalls in the book The Matriarch that he took the baby from the Royal Women's Hospital: ""He brought Jade home to me and said: 'You've got a granddaughter' ... He brought her about 10 o'clock at night, pissed.""
 
 She says Jade's mother Sissy discharged herself from hospital. ""She [said] she wanted to see the baby. She didn't want to see the baby. She wanted the smack underneath the mattress in the bassinet.""
 
 It was a portent of what was to come.
 
 Before she could walk she saw drug abuse, before she could talk she witnessed mindless violence and before she was old enough to go to school she was an orphan.
 
 She was in the family home when Allen and his half-brother Victor Peirce used a chainsaw to dismember the body of bikie Anton Kenny before putting the remains in a barrel and dumping them in the Yarra.
 
 A former model who lived there as Allen's sex slave, imprisoned by threats and a constant diet of illicit drugs, was playing with Jade and her sister in a bedroom at the time. She heard the shots when Kenny was executed. ""Dennis told me to take the kids to his brother's place.""
 
 Jade was too young to comprehend. ""I never felt scared. I felt safe and loved. I remember the violence but it wasn't scary because that's all I knew.""
 
 The chaotic violence around Allen was off the map. Bodies in the backyard, family members ordered to clean bloodstains, hostages beaten with bats and brooms and a man shot dead while changing a record. His body was never found.
 
 How many people Allen killed is anyone's guess. A police taskforce put the total at 11, which included deliberate drug hotshots inflicted on sex workers that were initially written off as self-inflicted overdoses. Those who should know in the underworld consider the figure conservative.
 
 Sissy was part wife, part accomplice and part prisoner. She was beaten, once left overnight chained to a washing machine, bashed with a gun butt by Allen, stabbed and dumped in the boot of her car. Allen's sister-in-law Wendy Peirce told me: ""Dennis opened the boot. Sissy was in there with her throat cut. It wasn't ear to ear but she lay there just gurgling. It was awful. I was helpless.
 
 ""He just slammed the boot shut and I spun out. He told someone to drive her somewhere and just leave her in a Dumpmaster. I got her dropped off at a railway station so someone would find her and take her to hospital. That saved her life.""
 
 By the time he was 30 Allen was making between $70,000 and $100,000 a week, owned several Richmond properties, had become a feared gangland boss in the area and was protected by corrupt cops. He took to wearing gold chains valued at more than $100,000, as if to confirm his occupation as drug dealer. He was a throwback - an old-fashioned borough boss - a crook who ran a small area around Cubitt, Chestnut and Stephenson streets in Cremorne, between Richmond and the Yarra.
 
 Jade's memories, understandably, are sketchy. She remembers parties, gold lights, her father sharpening giant knives on a stone, and fish tanks filled not with colourful species but piranhas and small sharks. There is a picture of him apparently giving her a cigarette when she was one.
 
 Her babysitter was cousin Jason Ryan: ""I looked up to Jason. He would give me chips with sauce.""
 
 Years later Jason Ryan would become a key police witness against members of the family charged with the October 1988 ambush murder of police constables Steven Tynan and Damian Eyre in Walsh Street, South Yarra.
 
 Her uncle, Trevor Pettingill, was one of the four men acquitted of the police murders.
 
 She says she was supposed to be raised by Victor Peirce. A career armed robber and gunman, he was also acquitted of the murders. In May 2003 he was shot dead in Bay Street, Port Melbourne.
 
 In August 1986 Sissy, 27, hanged herself in Pentridge Prison, leaving a note to her two daughters that she was sorry but just wanted the pain to stop. Jade was four.
 
 The following year Allen died of heart disease brought on by massive drug abuse. He was 35. At the age of five Jade was an orphan. She says her father, wealthy from drug dealing, made out a will to look after his two daughters. His mother Kath Pettingill was executor: ""We were supposed to have had a Catholic education. There was nothing. She has had nothing to do with us.""
 
 Jade says even now she would like Pettingill to hand over any items from her father. She went to seven primary schools, spent most of her time crying in toilets and was told a series of false stories about her parents' death, including that they died in a car crash.
 
 She said it was only when she read The Matriarch that she learned the truth. ""I was 12 or 13. It had a massive impact on me.""
 
 Sissy's mother, Heather Hill, took on the task of raising the two girls. Heather had six daughters. Three died, two from overdoses and one a suicide.
 
 ""I resented my mother [for taking her own life]. As a mother I don't understand how she could leave her kids,"" says Jade. But she says she loves her father, even though he was a killer.
 
 She remembers being left at the bottom of steps in housing commission flats to play by herself while family members took drugs inside. ""Nan was a recovering alcoholic. She tried her best and always tried to keep us away from that [Allen] family.""
 
 We meet in a trendy cafe in Carlton. She is nervous, laughs readily then is moved to tears as she talks of her darkest times. She is a fighter but the battles have taken a toll.
 
 Eventually she moved to Queensland to live with Sissy's sister, Kellie Carter-Bell. But Kellie was caught in a toxic, violent relationship. The father of her children hunted her down and attacked her, plunging a knife into her heart. Amazingly, she survived. (After more than two decades of violence Kellie escaped and is now a powerful advocate against family violence.)
 
 ""She moved to me in year seven. Jade had seen so much,"" says Kellie.
 
 Jade went on the run - making a small amount of cash as a teenager from babysitting. The 24-year-old father of the children Jade looked after started to drop around home during the day when his de facto wife was at work.
 
 ""He drove me around in a nice car, bought me clothes and gave me speed,"" she says. ""I now know I was groomed.""
 
 By the time she was 17 she was pregnant. The father beat her. ""My son learned to crawl over to me when he was bashing me on the floor.""
 
 They would go to a country property where he would shoot at targets. ""I was so scared he was going to shoot me and bury me there. They would never have found the body.""
 
 Soon it began the usual spiral - lost years, drug addiction, bad friends and a twilight existence. The prospect of a second child made her face reality. She escaped her violent partner, hid in a women's refuge and eventually returned to Melbourne.
 
 Jade Allen hates seeing her father portrayed as a monster - even though he was. She detests her grandmother Kath Pettingill, feeling she failed to provide any help when it was needed.
 
 She could have gone down the same path as many of that clan - drugs, self-destruction and premature death. But somehow she didn't.
 
 Three of her four children live with her. They have a three-bedroom public housing flat that is the family oasis. ""It is our little castle,"" she says.
 
 Kellie Carter-Bell says: ""She is an amazing woman. Her strength is amazing. She has struggled, then thrived, struggled and thrived again. She has fought her demons and won.""
 
 Jade is proud of her home: ""I have OCD so I am always cleaning. If I stop, I think, and thinking is not always a good thing."" Eventually she turned her obsession into a business. She is a one-person professional cleaning company, often preparing Airbnb accommodation for the next visitors. She speaks with pride of being able to make a living: ""I want to protect my children.""
 
 Jade, the survivor, has done the near impossible. She broke the cycle.",1565
32,Bringing judges who behave badly to account,Fairfax,2020-06-29T02:05:32.843Z,"I hope the explosive allegations made against former judge Dyson Heydon will create the Australian legal profession's #MeToo moment.
 
 As a female legal academic, former practising lawyer, and judge's associate, I hope that the explosive allegations made against former High Court judge Dyson Heydon will create the Australian legal profession's #MeToo moment. It is my professional culture. I have lived it and observed it. We need a moment to expose, examine and fundamentally change a culture that tolerates sexual predation.
 
 In addition, as a legal academic who has studied the accountability for complaints against judges for almost a decade, I also hope these findings provide a long-awaited catalyst for fixing the larger accountability vacuum that still yawns over the Australian federal judiciary. It is a vacuum that has allowed sexist, racist and other troubling conduct to go largely unaddressed.
 
 The complaints made to the Chief Justice of the High Court against Heydon by his former associates were investigated by an administrative inquiry that had to be especially set up for the task. The inquiry's six recommendations were tailored to redress the particular position of power held by a judge over an associate. These changes are needed. The judge-associate relationship is held between a senior legal practitioner and someone entering the profession, and is both professional, yet deeply personal.
 
 However, the investigations by the Herald into Heydon's conduct towards members of the legal profession and the judiciary demonstrates the unique position of judges extends beyond the judge-associate relationship and cuts through the entire profession in malignant ways.
 
 Judges occupy an extraordinary, status-based position within the legal profession. In all contexts - including private ones - deference is accorded to judges by lawyers who may have to appear before them. Deference is displayed to higher court judges from those in lower courts whose judgments might be overturned by them. It is displayed from legal academics, who hope their work might be influential to their legal thinking. And the whole legal profession feels the responsibility for maintaining the idea that judges are of the highest integrity.
 
 The allegations against Heydon, and the bravery of the women who have spoken up, provide us not only with a moment to change the culture of the legal profession, but with a moment to introduce an institutional change that will bring judges who behave badly to account.
 
 At the federal level in Australia, there is no independent regulatory mechanism to deal with complaints against judges - be they related to sexual misconduct or otherwise.
 
 That's not to say there aren't many ways in which the judiciary are accountable - including through appeals, the principle that judicial proceedings are conducted in public (although the extent to which this has been able to be maintained during the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted weaknesses) and, of course, as individuals through the criminal justice system.
 
 But, unlike, for instance, the legal or medical professions, or the public service, these avenues for accountability are not designed to provide an independent, standing institutional response when an individual has a professional complaint about the conduct of a judge - be that on or off the bench.
 
 A standing, independent complaints body with appropriate powers would ensure there is a place for complaints to be received, the capacity to investigate them and an independent body to impose penalties should misconduct be found.
 
 It would avoid the accusation, made on Heydon's behalf by his lawyers, that the process undertaken in his case was ""conducted by a public servant and not by a lawyer, judge or a tribunal member"", ""without statutory powers of investigation and of administering affirmations or oaths"", and that it may have failed to accord procedural fairness.
 
 At present, complaints against judges must be made either to the Attorney-General or the chief justice of the court itself. If a complaint is made, investigated and found to be substantiated, there is no penalty short of removal of the judge. Removal of a judge can only occur if both Houses of Parliament agree to it. It is an all or nothing option subject to partisan influences and political opportunism and argy-bargy. There has never been a federal judge removed in Australia.
 
 It is an interesting thought experiment to contemplate whether, had Heydon been a sitting High Court judge, the allegations against him would have been enough to have him removed from the bench. Maybe.
 
 But what about if there were a similar suite of allegations against a lower level judge? Would that have been sufficient? It would, I think, depend on the extent of media coverage, the people involved, the general political context at the time the allegations were made - and it shouldn't.
 
 I'm not claiming there are pandemic levels of misconduct within the judiciary. But there are sufficient levels to require an institutional response. The allegations against Heydon provide us with but one recent example. There are myriad others.
 
 The allegations that emerged over the course of last year of incompetence, rudeness and bias against federal circuit court judge Sandy Street and of incompetence, rudeness and unfairness against his fellow circuit court judge Salvatore Vasta provide us with two others. For months, there was no institutional response to the conduct of these two judges. This was despite a number of complaints, including from the Law Council of Australia. Finally, the Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit Court, Will Alstergren, indicated that the judges had agreed to counselling. Some penalty.
 
 Also last year, a Northern Territory judge, Greg Borchers, was found - for a second time - to have made comments that contained negative racial stereotypes. It was conduct that the then Law Council of Australia president, Arthur Moses SC, branded ""disparaging, discriminatory and offensive, insulting and humiliating to Indigenous Australians based solely on their race"". This notwithstanding, Chief Judge Elizabeth Morris said that in the absence of a complaints framework, she could impose no sanctions. The Chief Justice of the Northern Territory, Michael Grant, called for an overhaul of the regulatory framework.
 
 In 2013, a South Australian judge, Anne Bampton, was arrested with a blood alcohol level of 0.12, driving home from a function, after she hit a cyclist. She pleaded guilty to the criminal charge and was fined $1300. The Chief Justice Chris Kourakis took Justice Bampton off cases relating to traffic offences and sentencing offenders affected by alcohol. He explained there was no further institutional penalty he could impose.
 
 Some states and territories have implemented mechanisms to deal with misbehaving judges. In 2012, efforts were made to formalise the mechanism at the federal level. These, however, fell far short of establishing an independent commission.
 
 In any event, the High Court was exempt from the 2012 changes, on the basis that the High Court occupies a ""special position"", and that - because the High Court sits at the apex of the judicial system - it may be called upon to determine the constitutional validity of any oversight mechanism.
 
 What the allegations against Heydon demonstrate is the pressing need for a mechanism to receive, investigate and respond to complaints against the federal judiciary. Any oversight mechanism must extend to the High Court, and should also cover the conduct of former judges, who continue to enjoy an elevated status within the legal profession.
 
 Certainly, such a mechanism must be established with particular attention paid to judicial independence. But such a design is not impossible, and many other countries, including Canada and Britain, have achieved this. Its establishment would be an important step demonstrating that our legal system does not tolerate anyone acting with impunity.

33,Budget a missed opportunity on sensitive issues,Fairfax,2020-04-10T04:14:21.283Z,"The $98 billion of spending announced in Tuesday's budget should successfully support the economy through the COVID-19 recession but it has left some key constituents disappointed. The budget has relied mostly on economy-wide cuts in business and personal income tax to stimulate the economy.
 
 Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says he does not like to tell people how to spend their money. Yet that choice raises questions about areas from aged care to social housing which have largely missed out in this budget.
 
 One large group which deserved more consideration is older women who have either been unemployed for a long period of time due to a stalled job market or have been otherwise disadvantaged by the pandemic and its ensuing recession. Many of them thought the government might have been able to tailor more support for their predicament, given how disproportionately hard they have been hit by the coronavirus recession.
 
 Perhaps sensing his vulnerability on the issue Mr Frydenberg offered a ""women's economic security"" package, but at a cost of just $240 million over five years it looks tokenistic. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says there are other programs which are designed to help these individuals, however it would seem they have not been effective so far.
 
 Another choice which could come at some political cost is the decision to restrict the JobMaker hiring credit to workers under 35. Mr Frydenberg says under 35s are most likely to be scarred for life by a bout of long-term unemployment. Unfortunately, the targeted approach highlights the relative lack of support for older unemployed workers who in this recession are more likely to be women.
 
 The budget is also a missed opportunity to increase spending on aged care despite the clear need to lift the appalling standards of care at many homes exposed by the pandemic. Funding aged care would also create lots of jobs, especially for women, and stimulate the economy.
 
 The government says it is waiting for the final report of the royal commission into aged care before announcing more cash but the budget should have included a firm pledge with some dollar signs.
 
 The budget's failure to decide the future of JobSeeker will also add to economic uncertainty for the 8 per cent of the workforce expected to be unemployed by the end of the year. They are fearful their benefit will drop to the pre-crisis Newstart dole allowance. The government says it will make a decision before JobSeeker expires at the end of the year but it is hard to see what it is waiting for.
 
 The government has also largely ignored calls from economists to stimulate the economy by investing in social housing. Without budget support, investment in new housing is expected to fall 11 per cent this year.
 
 The government can argue that it relies on business and consumers to power the recovery. Yet the discovery of the first three cases of community transmission of COVID-19 in NSW in 12 days is a necessary reminder of how fragile the situation is.
 
 Large outbreaks could still undermine the improvement in business confidence and consumer sentiment and the reopening of borders on which the budget's forecast for a return to growth next year is based.
 
 The federal government should consider more targeted programs, which will ensure no one is left behind - especially if the tax cuts in the budget fail to buck up consumers or stir the animal spirits of business.

34,CALIFORNIA DREAMIN’? MORE AN IDENTITY-QUOTA TERROR,News,2021-04-24T18:47:19.103Z,"I’d be safe and sound if I was in LA? No, that’s just another dangerous woke myth After visiting the Soviet Union in 1919, American investigative journalist Lincoln Steffens famously proclaimed: “I’ve seen the future, and it works.” Today’s beacon of hope for delusional, emotionally overwrought progressives is California. So rational shareholders and company directors, and society at large, should take a close look at the latest developments on affirmative action quotas in California with a sense of impending terror. Given that we are on the same path, driven by the same ideology and beliefs — or rather myths — it is quite possible that California’s today is our tomorrow. And what a misguided Soviet-era model of central command and control it is.
 
 California law already requires that by the end of next year, any publicly held corporation, whether domestic or foreign, with its principal executive offices in California must have at least three female directors if it has six or more people on its board, or at least two if it has five on its board. A female is defined as “an individual who self-identifies her gender as a woman, without regard to the individual’s designated sex at birth”.
 
 Now, under a new law that came into force on September 30, any publicly held corporation headquartered in California must also meet quotas for a range of minorities. By December 31 next year any corporation with a California HQ must have at least one director from “an under-represented community” on its board. By the end of the following year, a sliding scale will determine the number of “diverse” directors. Companies with four or fewer directors must have at least one director from an under-represented community; those with between five and nine directors must have at least two minority directors; and those with nine or more must have at least three diversity directors.
 
 “Director from an under-represented community” means an individual who self-identifies as black, African-Amer­ican, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian or Alaska Native, or as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. And fines apply: $US100,000 ($139,000) for the first violation, up to $US300,000 for each subsequent violation.
 
 Leave aside for one moment the obvious scope for abuse by spurious self-identity, the potential for avoidance by shifting headquarters out of California, and the constitutional doubts on this legislation, the killer question is: is this just a Hollywood-inspired nightmare, or could it happen here?
 
 If you listen to Debby Blakey, chief executive of industry super fund HESTA, and her colleagues in other activist industry super funds, the Californian rules seem to be the logical end point of what they want. In a letter to companies in the S&P ASX 200 Index, HESTA says it regards gender representation and diversity as an indicator of the quality of a com­pany’s governance and manage­ment of “‘social licence to operate” risks. “For HESTA to assess whether a company is managing for these risks, we will be looking at gender equality and diversity as an indicator of fairness,” it says.
 
 The none-too-subtle hint is that if boards don’t have directors representing every conceivable minority group (except, it would seem, those with skill and experience), the industry funds will vote against them at board elections. The alleged intellectual underpinning for this charmingly thuggish use of voting power is twofold. First, the assertion is that diverse companies are more profitable and so it is in shareholders’ interests to demand diverse boards. Second, companies lose their “social licence to operate” if their boards do not reflect the various minority groups in society (presumably in the proportion those groups are represented in society).
 
 The first argument is invariably asserted rather than proved. It has long rested, precariously, on a few studies showing a correlation between the number of women on corporate boards and in senior management with strong financial performance. Bah, humbug. Correlation is not the same as causation; it is equally possible women flock to strong companies because they value security or prize the kind of workplace flexibilities and entitlements strong companies can afford.
 
 Having cottoned on to the fact correlation is a crock, the Workplace Gender Equality Agency recently teamed up with a couple of academics from the Bankwest Curtin Economic Centre to claim they have found the holy grail — causation between appointing women to senior positions in a company and the company’s performance. But it is going to take far more rigorous research than one involving this activist group to prove, rather than assert, that more women improve corporate performance. The more likely scenario is that well-managed companies draw on a wider pool of talent, including women, when filling senior positions.
 
 In other words, claims that gender diversity and ethnicity or sexual preference produce better financial outcomes for a company remain nothing more than an act of faith, or perhaps superstition.
 
 The second argument, let’s call it the California Dreamin’ one, claims that a board, even partly chosen for its representative qualities rather than its skills, is better for investors. It is equally bogus for its lack of evidence. And only a group as politically powerful and activist as industry super funds could argue with a straight face that superannuation nest eggs are best protected by choosing directors according to ethnicity or sexual preference rather than skill and experience. Industry funds seem to have no shame about effectively expropriating shareholders funds to advance their political or social objectives. Is it any wonder the government is contemplating slowing up the flood of money into industry super funds — why would you give them a cent more than necessary when they waste it on crackpot activism?
 
 So, are we condemned to Californian-style board selection by quota, to dividing board spoils among ethnic minorities like some failed Balkan state? The good news is it won’t happen quickly. We may be rescued from ethnicity and sexual preference targets by the self-interest of the gender activists; today’s wealthy and woke quota queens have no interest in letting real diversity targets spoil the bonanza they’re now enjoying.
 
 That said, there is not much room for complacency. Intellectual laziness and the desire to save face at inner-city dinner parties has already caused a near wholesale surrender to elitist gender quotas. So it falls to others, every time there is a push for more of this guff, be it gender or minority quotas, to point out the lack of logic and evidence. Not just to protect shareholders, but because society must distinguish between “progressive” assertions and progress. Failure to fight back against the woke diversity activists will ensure a Californian-style ending for Australia too. As Churchill is reputed to have said, an appeaser is someone who continues to feed the crocodile in the hope it will eat him/her last.",1170
35,Continuing the fight for women's rights,Fairfax,2021-12-18T10:43:54.869Z,"Stott Despoja is no stranger to misogyny but the pandemic brings new dangers, writes Katina Curtis.
 
 As the youngest woman to enter the senate, Natasha Stott Despoja has copped plenty of sexist and personal criticism in her public life.
 
 In response to a male columnist scrutinising the supposedly cheap purple suit she wore in her early days in Parliament, she joked that ""the devil wore Portmans, not Prada"".
 
 This week she was again championing women's rights and gender equality when she spoke at the National Press Club of the devastating escalation of domestic and family violence during the pandemic and lockdowns. She wants change to stop the ""slaughter in the suburbs"".
 
 Who is she?
 
 Natasha Stott Despoja emerged into public life from the late 1980s University of Adelaide political culture that also produced Christopher Pyne, Penny Wong and South Australian Labor premier Jay Weatherill.
 
 In 1995, aged 26, she was chosen to represent the Democrats in South Australia in the Senate. She spent 13 years in the upper house, including nearly four years as the party's deputy leader and a turbulent 18 months at its helm. In Parliament she championed a range of causes including paid maternity leave, same-sex marriage, an Australian republic, genetic privacy and stem cell research. But she also copped the sexist and personal criticisms aimed at all women in the public eye, something she has since spoken out stridently against.
 
 What does she do?
 
 In her post-politics career, Stott Despoja has championed women's rights and gender equality. She served as Australia's ambassador for women and girls from 2013 to 2016 and is currently campaigning for a spot in the United Nations' Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. It's the first time in almost 30 years Australia has backed a candidate for the committee - but she doesn't know when she'll find out if the bid is successful, with the June 29 vote postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
 She's also the inaugural chair of Our Watch, a government-backed organisation formed in 2013 to push for change in Australian culture and attitudes that lead to violence against women and children.
 
 What she did this week?
 
 It was in her capacity as Our Watch chair that Stott Despoja delivered her grim but impassioned speech about domestic violence this week.
 
 The statistics she reeled off about that violence's escalation during the COVID-19 lockdowns were devastating.
 
 A 600 per cent increase in reports of revenge porn just on the Easter weekend. Nearly one in 20 women were assaulted sexually or physically by a current or former partner between March and May - two-thirds of them for the first time. A two-thirds jump in demand for emergency accommodation in South Australia. A 130 per cent rise in new family violence matters in Canberra.
 
 ""There has been more violence in more Australian homes. The severity of violence has increased and COVID is actually being weaponised within the home as a tool of abuse,"" Stott Despoja said. ""How could we not be haunted by this violence, Australia?""
 
 Why is this important?
 
 There have been small but vital gains made on equality and attitudes to women and Stott Despoja fears they could be wiped out by COVID-19. That said, she's also hopeful governments, business and society will seize the opportunity for change.
 
 ""I know that many of you are sickened by the stories, the statistics, the body count, the slaughter in the suburbs and I know we can't go on like this, so does this awful crisis bring an opportunity for change? I hope so,"" she said.
 
 A starting point would be for the government to use a ""gender lens"" when examining its budget - thinking about whether its economic recovery actually targets the female workforce and those industries that have been hit hardest.
 
 Stott Despoja points out that over the years Australia has been a world leader in primary prevention on things like smoking, safe driving and sun safety, so we know how to do this.
 
 She's impatient for change but also knows cultural shifts take generations. Changing attitudes - like those of one in five young men who think domestic violence is a normal reaction to everyday stress or frustration - needs
 
 buy-in from everyone.
 
 And it needs better messaging. From Bachelor in Paradise star Ciarran Stott (who is no relation) saying another suitor can't date his ex-girlfriend without first getting permission, to AMP promoting executive Boe Pahari despite having penalised him $500,000 for settling a sexual harassment claim - Stott Despoja says there is still a long way to go.",790

37,Cutting the roots of family violence,Fairfax,2020-01-03T15:30:36.270Z,"Too many people, mostly women, are dying. It's time for a new approach with a focus on mental health.
 
 Domestic violence is one of the most significant public health issues in Australia. As a psychologist, I have seen the impact of domestic violence for adults and children. As a parliamentarian, I see its impact on a national scale.
 
 According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, one woman is killed every nine days and one man is killed every 29 days by a partner.
 
 Any person can experience domestic or intimate partner violence, regardless of gender, culture, sexual orientation or socioeconomic background.
 
 Despite consistent funding, including the Morrison government's additional $328 million into the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children, domestic violence is occurring at an alarming rate in Australia and is likely to record a spike over the holiday period.
 
 The Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence found domestic violence is the leading contributor to preventable death, disability and illness in women aged 15 to 45.
 
 The cost to our health system, judicial system, emergency services and society at large is enough of a reason to take action to get to the root cause.
 
 Over the past decade, we have seen the government implement front-line services such as 1800RESPECT, improve the legal system and drive cultural change to stop attitudes of disrespect from escalating to violence. While we wait for attitudes to change, people, mostly women, are dying.
 
 It is time for a new approach, and I believe a mental health focus is paramount. Mental health issues are at the core of domestic violence. Children who have grown up experiencing or witnessing domestic violence have a higher risk of depression, anxiety, relationship issues and substance abuse.
 
 They are also more likely to become victims or perpetrators of domestic violence in their adult years. Survivors of domestic violence can benefit from mental health support to avoid this cycle from continuing in the future.
 
 We must acknowledge situational triggers such as financial stress, but we would all agree financial stress alone does not cause someone to act violently towards another person.
 
 When we dig a little deeper, what lie beneath are specific psychological symptoms - poor coping skills, poor emotion regulation, poor distress tolerance, poor impulse control, a lack of empathy, and so on.
 
 Early childhood trauma and poor coping mechanisms lead many to addictive behaviours, and substance abuse tends to coincide with domestic violence. For instance, one in three domestic violence cases reported involve alcohol. There are many examples where tackling substance abuse and addiction can significantly reduce violence.
 
 Addressing the mental health of those engaging in domestic violence is critical. Just as important is preventing aggressive and violent behaviours from developing at all.
 
 The pieces fall into place when we consider that young Australian men are the least likely to access mental health services and are more likely to exhibit poor mental health through behaviours such as aggression, substance abuse and risk-taking. Many men are unaware that the symptoms and experiences they are having are psychological and linked to their mental health. For others, stigma makes it difficult for them to seek help.
 
 For many men, intimate partner violence can be a response to experiencing intense emotions of humiliation or powerlessness. We can reduce our high rate of domestic violence if we're willing to see it as a mental health problem, if we're willing to identify and treat the underlying psychological symptoms to prevent aggressive or controlling behaviour from developing.
 
 To reduce domestic violence in Australia we must implement widespread psycho-educational campaigns to identify and de-stigmatise mental health problems.
 
 We must break down the barriers and do more to encourage help-seeking behaviour.
 
 First, we can model pro-social behaviours, healthy relationships and helpful coping mechanisms to our children. Evidence-based parenting programs offer useful advice, but early intervention is the key for many problematic behaviours. It's time to better integrate ""wellbeing and mental health"" into our education curriculum. We should be utilising well-established evidence-based approaches such as cognitive behavioural techniques to help reduce the underlying psychological symptoms associated with those who go on to engage in aggressive controlling behaviours.
 
 The Morrison government has invested more money into mental health than any other previous government. For the first time in Australia, mental health is a major policy priority. This gives us an opportunity to build an integrated and accessible mental health system that lays the foundation for addressing a wide range of issues across society, including domestic violence. Ideally, scientific evidence drives public policy. It's time to end domestic violence - and our mental health policy is the key.

38,"Dear J.K. Rowling, let's end this toxic 'debate'",Fairfax,2020-08-03T04:54:29.415Z,"J.K. Rowling, the world's best-known teller of tales of magic and wizardry, is once again using her public platform to question whether transwomen are, indeed, women.
 
 I can't say I am a fan of the Harry Potter series. I lost faith in spells when my own body failed to magically transform from boy to girl despite endless nights of prayers and wishes. But my heart goes out to the many people in the trans community who were fans. I too have known the pain and disappointment you feel when someone you idolise dismisses and invalidates your very being.
 
 Some consider Rowling's latest comments part of an ongoing ""debate"" about trans and gender diverse rights. I'm going to call it out for what it really is - a privileged assumption of entitlement on the part of Rowling and her ilk to ""debate"" my very existence and validity.
 
 In between jumping through hoops to access healthcare, play sport, correct my identity documents and stay safe while using public toilets, I'm also expected to engage in a debate about whether I'm woman enough to meet an unreasoned standard of womanhood construed from physiology and life experience. This is the restrictive definition of womanhood Rowling advocates.
 
 I honestly don't know how some folks have come to the conclusion that my desire for basic fundamental rights as a transgender woman is at odds with the fight for woman's rights more broadly. We're all seeking respect, dignity and equality. Alongside gender, there are many factors that shape human experience, such as place of birth, health, religion, disability, biology, race, sexuality and wealth. Does a woman living in poverty in a developing country have the same experience of womanhood as a wealthy woman in Australia? Is the woman who can't or chooses not to have children less of a woman than those who have children? When did humanity, let alone womanhood become so narrow?
 
 I took the scenic route to womanhood. I first came out as transgender when I was 19. A psychologist I saw told me I'd be unlovable, face a hard life and would be an ugly woman if I transitioned. That forced me back into the closet for another 10 years to white-knuckle through the crippling impact of gender dysphoria before eventually reaching the junction of suicide or transition.
 
 The 19-year-old me could have never imagined the immediacy with which I was welcomed into womanhood with open arms by my fellow sisters. The first such occasion was being included in casual conversations about menstruation. I felt a little awkward and sad because it's not an experience I will ever be privy to, but the significance of inclusion was profound.
 
 I knew I'd well and truly made it through the pearly gates of womanhood the day my white middle-aged male mechanic called me ""love"" and mansplained my car engine to me. I couldn't decide whether I was more outraged or happy that my womanhood was so overwhelmingly affirmed. He probably overcharged me too.
 
 While Rowling and others continue the toxic ""debate"" about my womanhood, it couldn't be more at odds with my daily existence. I'm already a woman. It's not a matter that requires debate. But we do need improved visibility and representation for the trans and gender diverse community. More often than not, we are defined in popular culture by the prejudice and discrimination we face, a dehumanising process which fuels ongoing ""debate"".
 
 Now, if only there was a series of books and movies about a young transgender person who thought they were normal only to find out they were, actually, a wizard.

39,"Depp, Heard and the deterrence factor",Fairfax,2021-11-14T06:13:25.270Z,"Imagine receiving this text from your daughter: ""He's nuts mom. Violent and crazy. I am heartbroken that THIS is who I love."" Red flag.
 
 That's what Amber Heard told her mother in 2013, adding that the ""crazy mood swings and binges"" of her partner, Johnny Depp, made him like ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde - on a binge"". Red alert.
 
 Heard's sister Whitney Henriquez told London's High Court this week that she saw Depp punch Heard repeatedly in the head, signs of bruises and burns on Heard's arms and that Depp often destroyed his then-wife's phones. ""He really didn't like her working,"" Henriquez said, ""and this got worse the longer they were together ... Johnny was incredibly jealous and possessive."" Flashing red siren.
 
 Look, I can barely keep up with the details of the Depp and Heard court case and have recently lost the will to. Between the allegations of assault and counter assault, there is a whole stinking pile of ugliness. The reporting has been tabloid, trashy and variable, statements have been contradictory, victim blaming has been obvious throughout, as has been the apparent surprise that relationships hallmarked by abuse can be messy and complicated, with neither partner destined for sainthood.
 
 There has also been an intense, sustained focus on Heard's reliability, credibility and apparent inconsistency. Suggestions she lied, fought back, hit him, hurt him. The headlines have read: ""Amber Heard admits she lied to her mum [about Depp]"", ""Lawyers claim this photo of Amber Heard proves she lied"", ""Amber Heard accused of lying"", ""Amber Heard and friends 'put heads together to lie about Depp""', ""Amber Heard admits to 'hitting' ex-husband Johnny Depp"", etc.
 
 I am not the judge; I don't know who did what and don't have the weight of evidence in front of me. Depp has every right to defend his reputation in court (against what he claims was libel over a Sun article that called him a ""wife-beater"".) His former partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder both gave statements saying the allegations were entirely at odds with the man they knew. Paradis called them ""outrageous"", containing ""false facts"". Ryder said: ""I do not want to call anyone a liar but from my experience of Johnny, it is impossible to believe that such horrific allegations are true."" It's murky.
 
 But I do know that we need to read these stories with extreme caution because when a high profile case of domestic abuse is dragged through the tabloids, those working on the front lines - police, lawyers, judges, community workers and advocates who work to protect victims of abuse - worry about blowback.
 
 What often happens is that ordinary women are less likely to be believed. Jess Hill, author of See What You Made Me Do, tells me the disproportionate attention celebrity cases attract can be problematic as ""if the victim retracts, or is found to have made false allegations, we don't just hear about it once, like we might for a generic court case, ... We see that story published over and over, so that the narrative in that one story drowns out all the others - literally, the millions of other domestic abuse stories that are going on every day around the world"".
 
 The message it repeats is often: women make things up and change their stories, without any understanding of why that might happen. And this message can, according to Chief Inspector Sean McDermott, manager of the
 
 Domestic and Family Violence Team of NSW Police, have ""unintended
 
 but dangerous consequences""
 
 for other women who report or
 
 who are considering whether to
 
 report domestic violence, often deterring them.
 
 What McDermott has observed is that reporting in cases of celebrity actors or sportsmen may suggest the allegations were fabricated ""for financial gain or for motives that are connected to family law issues"", or ""may draw attention to situations whereby a woman's 'history' is trawled so as to raise issues to discredit her as a witness"". Another problem occurs when alleged victims give evidence in court that directly contradicts their original statements to police, he says, because ""there are many valid reasons why women will choose to do so but these are invariably not acknowledged"". Right.
 
 Hayley Foster, the chief executive of Women's Safety NSW, points out that victims of domestic violence often ""deny or minimise the violence or abuse at an earlier stage and then, when feeling safe, finally make a disclosure"". This does not then mean they were lying, she says, but ""rather, it tends to be a consequence of them living within the context of coercive control, where they may come to doubt their own experiences and their own responsibility for what is happening to them at the time, and they may even have legitimate fears as to the consequences for their safety if they were to disclose the violence and abuse. Understanding this context of coercive control is important"".
 
 Part of the problem is our irrational desire to have a completely flawless victim, one who garners all of our sympathy without complication, one who never changes a statement, never remembers things incompletely, never retaliates. Annabelle Daniel, the chief executive of Women's Community Shelters, told me: ""Those working with domestic and family violence understand that surviving an abusive relationship is an unrelenting struggle, with fear and the impacts of trauma present even during so-called 'peaceful' periods. Trauma significantly impacts memory and our emotional and physical responses."" The reports you see of pretty, famous faces rarely contain even a primitive understanding of what trauma can do to a person who has survived, or is still enduring abuse.
 
 And the tendency to think women lie about abuse is not borne out by evidence. Research shows false allegations are relatively rare, as Hill says, ""what is more common is for victims to minimise the abuse they've suffered, withdraw their testimony and ask for charges to be dropped.
 
 That is what magistrates tell me time and again. But is that what people think after reading these celebrity stories? Do we contextualise the reporting to say that the behaviour of one celebrity is anomalous, and not a reflection of the majority?""
 
 At the conclusion of her four days of evidence, Heard she had decided to appear because ""every day more and more attacks were coming out accusing me of being a liar"". When asked what the benefit of speaking out was, she answered: ""What woman has ever benefited from being a victim of domestic violence, particularly by a powerful entity in their own industry?"" It's an excellent question.
 
 But whatever is determined to have happened between her and Depp, the crucial point is: this is just one case.

40,EDITOR'S LETTER,News,2021-11-09T16:41:27.574Z,"Two words have dominated the conversation this year — jobs and COVID-19. The national debate has never been so narrowed and so focused, with very little room for issues that do not, in some way at least, intersect with the dominant discourse.
 
 Every area of life has been seen through the lens of the global pandemic and the economic disruption it has caused. For women, the key themes of recent years — equality in the boardroom and executive ranks; unconscious bias; the questions about when or whether to have children — have slipped down the list.
 
 This year has been about employment, about part-time work, about government subsidies failing or assisting women, and childcare. The overarching issues remain but for many women the focus must be on very practical matters — how to get and keep a job; and how to manage childcare.
 
 Looked at through the COVID-19 lens, this has been a mixed year for women. On the plus side, their advocacy of working from home arrangements and flexible work has been given a huge boost now that it’s endorsed by bosses as an option for men as well as women. Part-time work — specifically part-time work at home — has been awarded more status. On the downside, women suffered greater unemployment in the early stages of the pandemic, were given little specific attention in the October budget and looked likely to find it hard to get jobs post-COVID-19.
 
 The jury is still out about the longer-term impact on women’s employment but the surrounding issues — about the insecurity of female -dominated sectors such as hospitality and events management — will continue.
 
 So too will the anxiety and frustration felt by many women about inadequate childcare options. And while the number of women CEOs may not be top of mind for women struggling to hang onto their jobs, the unconscious gender bias in our society is worth remembering.
 
 This year brought strong criticism of a senior female leader, Australia Post’s Christine Holgate, and raised the question of whether a male leader who used watches rather than cash bonuses to reward executives would have been dealt with so publicly and summarily. Was it unconscious sexism or unconscious populism that drove some of the responses to the Cartier watch affair? And is the political reluctance to truly address childcare options caused by the fact that childcare is still seen as a problem for women, rather than parents, to solve?
 
 This is our sixth annual women’s special, produced in partnership with Chief Executive Women, which in 2020 under president Sue Morphet campaigned strongly on jobs and childcare. CEW’s advocacy role crystallised as the pandemic upended work and families.
 
 Morphet has been succeeded by Sam Mostyn, whose two-year tenure began this week. Mostyn’s long career across so many aspects of Australian business and society positions her perfectly to continue to lead CEW through a period when applying the gender lens as well as the COVID-19 lens will be crucial. Thank you to art director Shireen Nolan, picture editor Christine Westwood and production editor Anne-Maree Gale for their work on this special.

41,Equal representation first step on path to necessary changes,Others,2021-05-27T12:19:43.373Z,"COMMENT
 
 Australia's federal system is buckling under the weight of border closures and the Commonwealth and states in loud dispute over who is responsible for failures of pandemic control when it comes to cruise ships and aged care. If that weren't enough pressure on the creaky frame of federalism, add in the impact on Australia's anxious population with people no longer able to travel freely and with Victoria's residents curfewed in their own homes. But the pressure on Australia's constitutional design is broader than state ""differences"" when it comes to regulating Australians' lives. There are demanding gender issues pushing on the constitutional structure and the pursuit of good public policy and more cohesive intergovernmental relations.
 
 Recounting important history, the move to create a federation in the 1890s took place when white women were becoming increasingly politically active, particularly about suffrage. While women did not participate directly in the constitutional conventions preceding Federation, by 1896 South Australian women were voting and a number of women in all colonies were experienced campaigners in political struggles. The Women's Christian Temperance Union supported federation, seeing advantages in greater national co-operation and the possibility (not achieved) of uniform welfare standards. In 1898, the Women's Federal League, formed in Sydney, worked with the Australasian Federation League to persuade white men, the only people allowed to vote in NSW at the time, to vote for federation. Yet others were sceptical about the capacity of federal institutions to deliver gender equality. Rose Scott became an avid ""anti-Billite"" after the Convention decided to exclude women's suffrage from the draft constitution. It was not only on the issue of suffrage that Scott opposed federation; she saw the newly formed nation-state as concerned primarily with armies and government buildings, at the expense of matters of higher priority to women. Federation in her view would take decision making to a ""faraway federal parliament"" out of the reach of ordinary people including, importantly, the ""mothers of the nation"", ordinary women whose responsibilities in the private sphere would render them less able to bridge the geographical distance than men. She was prescient in predicting the practical difficulties for women considering standing for the Commonwealth Parliament.
 
 Scott's worries were confirmed by the late entry of lone women to Parliament and the continuing under-representation of women in state and federal legislatures, still today hovering at less than a third of all members. Policy decisions in the wake of COVID have uncovered the acute absence of a gender lens and a failure to address the glaring iniquities and inequalities the pandemic has exacerbated. Two stand out with particular force - the shocking incidence of domestic violence in Australia and the need for a more accessible system of childcare to enable men and women with caring needs to better participate in the workforce. These are not just ""women's issues"" but societal issues requiring profound changes in gendered norms and social practices that need coordinated federal approaches that link cultural change with structural change.
 
 Why have these questions not been adequately addressed through our current frameworks? Under-representation is at the heart of it. There is such an obvious lack of equal participation in political and administrative executive positions flowing through to the paucity of women's presence in key intergovernmental arrangements, including Premiers' Conferences, Ministerial Councils and, from the early 1990s until June of 2020, the peak intergovernmental forum in Australia, the Council of Australian Governments.
 
 On May 29, 2020, Scott Morrison announced that he and the premiers and chief ministers had agreed to continue the national cabinet established to coordinate Australia's response to COVID-19, ceasing COAG and forming a new National Federation Reform Council. The former director-general of the Western Australian Department of Premier and Cabinet and former Commonwealth cabinet secretary, Peter Conran AM, is leading a review of the former COAG councils and ministerial forums, in order to rationalise and reset their work. The terms of reference for the review sets out avenues for consultation with Commonwealth and state and territory ministers and officials, with the national cabinet, noting that additional bodies may be identified for consultation through the course of the review.
 
 Importantly, in March of this year, just before COAG was overtaken by the national cabinet, the Women's Safety Ministers Council of COAG with responsibility for coordinating action on prevention and response to domestic violence, which had earlier been an ad hoc meeting, was elevated to a COAG level group. It was meant to meet twice a year and in response to the pandemic agreed to meet quarterly. At its latest meeting on August 7 ministers agreed to work together to collect and analyse data showing the impact of COVID-19 on the safety of women and their children and committed to providing further data and reporting to support future action. While this is an important step the meeting was criticised for not implementing enough real action other than referring an inquiry into family, domestic and sexual violence to the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. While these council meetings are more visible, eradicating domestic, family and sexual violence requires a myriad of portfolios to be involved working across multiple portfolios. Where will their work now sit in the new framework?
 
 If, as the terms of reference set out, the objective of the national cabinet work is to ensure that the Australian community is served by a federal relations architecture that is responsive to issues confronting our community and economy, then equal numbers of women must be involved in all decision making processes. On June 12, 2020, national cabinet announced six initial priority areas of reform, and the formation of six national cabinet reform committees: Rural and Regional Australia, Skills, Energy, Infrastructure and Transport, Population and Migration and Health. Is the work of the Women's Safety Ministers Council going to be integrated into these committees or continue as an ad hoc structure?
 
 As at August 2020, five of the eight attorneys general are women. When looking at all state, territory and federal ministers around Australia, there are now 48 women holding those executive roles. It is imperative that Peter Conran's review and national cabinet ensures there are equal numbers of women on each of the six national cabinet reform committees. At the moment only two of the eight chief ministers are women. It is incumbent on each of the chief ministers in national cabinet to select from the 48 available women ministers and their senior women officers to represent them. This will be the first step to the necessary social and cultural change that Australia so desperately needs.

42,Everyone wins with new social housing,Fairfax,2020-06-20T17:36:12.837Z,"Sydney is not in hard lockdown like Melbourne is but the flow-on impacts for NSW are there - people being cautious, staying home and not spending as we wait to see which way it will go. This is a further brake on our metropolitan and regional economies.
 
 At a time when residential housing construction is in decline and tens of thousands of people are sleeping rough, living in overcrowded, unsafe conditions or spending years on social housing waiting lists, there is one fiscal policy lever that elegantly addresses both challenges - the construction of more social and affordable housing.
 
 The NSW government has been alive to issues in the construction industry, announcing changes including stamp duty reform and streamlined planning processes.
 
 As well, the government has recognised the need to support those sleeping rough and has moved more than 1900 individuals and families who were homeless or at risk of homelessness into social housing since April. These are welcome initiatives, but we can and must do more.
 
 According to Equity Economics, the forecast drop in international migration because of the pandemic will translate to reduced demand for housing of 38,500 units over 2020 and 2021 - the equivalent of an entire year of residential housing construction in NSW.
 
 As a result, up to 85,000 jobs are at risk in the residential construction sector across NSW over the next 18 months.
 
 Rising unemployment is projected to increase homelessness by between 7905 and 16,140 people in NSW, and increased homelessness is estimated to cost between $218 million and $445 million each year. A social and affordable housing boom can avert this, yet it seems to be the one infrastructure program that the NSW government is reluctant to embrace on the scale needed.
 
 It is hard to understand why. Not only would it deliver short-term stimulus at a time when our state is hurting, it changes lives for the better. It keeps women trying to escape toxic, violent relationships safe. It keeps our children in a safe and healthy environment - opening up opportunities that will improve their lives. In the words of one service provider, ""Can you imagine what kinds of cycles could be broken if there was more social and affordable housing and adequate income support?""

43,"Fierce, fabulous and flawed",Fairfax,2021-05-30T20:53:59.821Z,"So it's International Women's Day tomorrow and, like most years, as a feminist who writes a regular social commentary column in this publication, I've been asked to speak at various events observing the day.
 
 This would normally all be fine. I could repeat the same concerns I've been expressing passionately for years - the epidemic of domestic violence, wage inequality, inadequate childcare, male privilege, where to after #MeToo . . .
 
 But this year I proffered a new topic for discussion. And considering the sputtering and choking noises through the phone at its mention, it's one that women may not want to hear.
 
 But here goes anyway because I believe this needs to be said - we are not perfect. Yep, you read right. I am dubious of feminism painting women within the confines of suffragette and saint, no deviation allowed. This continuous narrative of male bad, female good, is too broadstroke. And, if we are really honest, it's also not helping.
 
 Now, that sound you heard is women taking to social media to condemn me for betraying my gender, to insult me for daring to go against the grain of what certain hardliners decree. However, I will cop the abuse for the greater good, even though the backlash, I know from experience, is brutal.
 
 Going off-piste today when discussing feminism is to literally wear a bullseye as a third eye. In the past, I have deviated from doctrine, daring to suggest in writing that men can and should refer to themselves as feminists, receiving the nastiest, personal bile as a result, one fellow writer going so far as to call me a ""traitorous c---"". So much for that sisterhood. And that was nothing compared to when I opined that certain religious or pro-life women should not be excluded from feminism for their beliefs, that the movement should be accommodating not alienating.
 
 Let's get one thing out of the way here before I continue - I am no Bettina Arndt. In fact, I would say the only thing the self-proclaimed men's rights activist and I have in common is a lack of a psychology degree. The columnist deserves to be honoured with an Order of Australia about as much as does convicted paedophile George Pell.
 
 However, I do believe that there is a middle ground that must be explored and celebrated by women, shades of grey that allow debate and free thought.
 
 An argument here to illustrate my point: yes, women do falsely accuse men of domestic assault or harming children in custody cases as post #MeToo investigations have shown. And yes, this is a tiny fraction that I agree gets way too much attention amid the bigger and imperative issue of valid sexual assaults against women.
 
 But I will not cop the hard-line feminist argument that this doesn't happen at all or there is ""no evidence"" to support such claims, that it's false news perpetuated by the patriarchy. Come on, ladies - we must grip the fact that we, too, can err.
 
 One Nation senator Pauline Hanson, whose views I respect about as much as Arndt's, recently expressed concern that some women were making up domestic violence claims in custody battles, which should be addressed in the Coalition's impending investigation into the family law system.
 
 Predictably, Hanson copped a pile-on. And again, I agree that instances of women abusing the system are minuscule in comparison to the epidemic of men abusing and endangering partners and children. However, I refuse to insist they never happen at all, to fall in line with what some believe it takes to be a ""true feminist"". I know they happen - albeit rarely - because women are human, too. I also have witnessed such an incident within my own friendship group.
 
 However, for the past 18 months, I have also watched as one of my girlfriends has been abused, hounded and defamed by her ex to the point where I have gravely feared for her safety. And the last thing I want to do is re-abuse any victim. What I do want to do is open up a discussion that appears currently closed, one that may help men understand their actions to help stop them. I want change and I don't see it likely to happen when feminist doctrine is demonising men as unalterable. We need to sometimes step down from the unchallenged higher ground.
 
 I believe that a black and white perception that centuries of suppression has made women superior or saintly is not helping. We need to embrace a moderate middle if parity is ever to be achieved. We need to say that, yes, the patriarchy still exists and it's evil. Yes, men must be stopped from abusing and killing women - by any means it takes and NOW! And yes, I will continue to fight with all the passion I can muster to keep women safe. I will remain defiantly feminist until the word is rendered redundant, replaced with humanism.
 
 But surely the fight for equality - which is and shall always be my feminist goal - shouldn't mean we repeat history and try to repress another gender or that we have no need for further introspection? Let's not make this literally tit for tat. How about we proudly celebrate International Women's Day for what we are - fierce, fabulous and flawed, too.

44,Fiscal stimulus key to stem jobless increase,Fairfax,2020-03-20T00:23:31.493Z,"The sharp rise in unemployment confirms that the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic will be the most severe in decades and demands a serious rethink of the government's economic strategy.
 
 The unemployment rate has jumped from 5.1 per cent to 7.1 per cent in just three months, which represents 205,000 more people on the dole. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a press conference that the data was heartbreaking.
 
 Bad as the headline unemployment rate is, the real situation is actually worse. The figure does not include hundreds of thousands of people who have given up looking for work entirely or who have been stood down on temporary JobKeeper payments and might lose their jobs when the wage subsidy expires. Meanwhile, thousands of part-timers are down to only a few hours a week and desperately want more shifts. Total hours worked have fallen 10.2 per cent since March.
 
 Mr Morrison said he saw a ""ray of light"" in the figures but, if so, it is the faintest flicker. Perhaps he means that the Australian Bureau of Statistics collected the data prior to May 30 and before many of the lockdown measures had been relaxed. He may be right that some jobs will return as lockdown eases. But it seems likely more jobs will not.
 
 International borders are very unlikely to reopen this year, which will postpone a recovery in tourism, hospitality and tertiary education, sectors - all huge employers, especially of women.
 
 The sharp fall in new immigrants - which has stalled population growth - will also hold back the economy for some time. In fact, there was a net outflow of 30,280 non-tourists in the period from March to May, compared with a net inflow of 23,000 in the same period in 2019.
 
 Without demand from new migrants, a glut of empty apartments will make it uneconomic for builders to embark on new projects, despite the government's HomeBuilder package.
 
 Mr Morrison once hoped the economy would snap back after the pandemic; he now says it will take five years for the economy to get completely back on track. This smacks of fatalism. This is a recession we probably could not have avoided but its length and severity will depend on economic policy. The government should take the advice of the Reserve Bank of Australia and deploy more fiscal stimulus to speed up recovery.
 
 Mr Morrison is right to be wary about going too deep into debt and wasteful spending. He is right to warn that he cannot continue to support zombie businesses indefinitely and that badly designed wage subsidies can give some workers a reason not to work. He is also right to look for long-term ways of boosting productivity. But until the private sector revives and confidence returns, government spending is the only way to create growth and jobs.
 
 Urgent action is required. The economy could fall into a much deeper hole in October after the expiry of the first round of stimulus measures such as the JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments, the one-off withdrawals from super accounts and the holidays on mortgage repayments.
 
 The government should now focus on how further stimulus should be delivered, whether it be by adjusting and extending JobKeeper and JobSeeker or through more investment in useful job-creating projects, such as social housing and renewable energy, or some other way.
 
 The jobs figures should convince the government that it has no choice but to spend more.",593
45,"Flawed bill is a weapon, not a shield",Fairfax,2020-03-16T19:21:42.207Z,"Federal Attorney-General Christian Porter on Monday published an article in this paper claiming his religious discrimination bill is intended merely as a ""shield"", and branded my criticisms of the bill as neither genuine nor constructive.
 
 His barbs were prompted by an article last week explaining how the religious discrimination bill would be bad for Christians - just as it is bad for gay people, women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and others.
 
 That article explained how the bill allows people to make ""statements of belief"" that ridicule, humiliate and intimidate Christians at work and at the shops, and how the bill actually encourages businesses to refuse to hire Christians.
 
  Christian Porter says the bill would not allow people to say things that intimidate others. His claim is not true. The bill overrides every existing federal, state and territory anti-discrimination law to allow ""statements of belief"", including statements of belief that intimidate other people - but not statements of belief that seriously intimidate other people.
 
 Plain intimidation is allowed, serious intimidation is not. Nobody really knows what the difference is between plain intimidation and serious intimidation. It will take an expensive court case to find out.
 
 But even serious intimidation might end up being allowed. The Australian Christian Lobby is calling for the restriction on serious intimidation to be removed.
 
 Let's pause for a moment. Scott Morrison and Christian Porter have actually written a law that will allow people to intimidate others: to intimidate gay people, women, people with disabilities, and Christians among others. This and many other provisions in the bill have been strongly criticised by federal and state human rights commissions, legal experts, business groups, and religious groups. The common criticism is that bill gives people the right to discriminate against others and overrides existing human rights protections.
 
 The Fair Work Act already makes it unlawful to subject a worker to adverse action at work on account of their religion or to sack a worker because of their religion. That's the law Israel Folau used.
 
 Legal experts have suggested constructive ways forward that would give Australia a broad federal law protecting people against religious discrimination, but without taking away existing human rights protections.
 
 I have suggested having a stock-standard anti-discrimination law. Such a law would protect people against religious discrimination but wouldn't override existing anti-discrimination and human rights protections, and wouldn't allow people to intimidate others. The anti-discrimination law experts group has made a similar suggestion.
 
 The Law Council of Australia has suggested consolidating all federal anti-discrimination laws into a single statute like those that exist at the state level. The new federal anti-discrimination law would then include religion as a protected attribute along with existing protected attributes like race, sex, disability and sexual orientation.
 
 The Attorney-General has ignored these suggestions. The religious discrimination bill in its current form is a powerful ""sword"" for people of all faiths to inflict harms on other people. Christian Porter should fix it or ditch it.

46,Former Liberal staffer laments her silence,Fairfax,2021-10-22T15:50:21.854Z,"Ten years on, Julia Gillard's ascent to the Labor leadership to become Australia's first female prime minister still ignites impassioned discourse.
 
 As with all leaders, her political record is still debated but so is her pathway to The Lodge - and the unique pressures and criticisms Gillard faced as a woman in the top job.
 
 Chelsey Potter's An open letter of apology to Julia Gillard from a former Liberal staffer was one of the most commented-on articles by The Age and Sydney Morning Herald readers in the past week.
 
 In the letter, the former long-time staffer to a Liberal minister lamented her own role in history for not speaking up against some of the worst treatment directed towards Gillard.
 
 ""I vigorously campaigned against you. I let ridiculous media commentary slide, ignored blatant sexism and overlooked some horrific campaign collateral,"" she wrote in the piece (first published in Women's Agenda).
 
 ""Julia, it cannot continue. Because I've been a woman a lot longer than I've been a Liberal.""
 
 Potter noted that apologising wasn't the done thing in politics - that it came at a price. While some men continued to be ""reluctant to change or challenge a system that favours and protects them"", it was up to women to instigate change, to continue to chip away at the glass ceiling and support women, whatever their political colours.
 
 Potter's apology was praised by many readers.
 
 amusedmuse: ""It's a brave thing to rise above party politics and show some personal integrity. If only others from both sides of the spectrum could do the same thing! Australia would be so much the better for it.""
 
 I believe whatever my party's policy says: ""Thank you for the ray of light. Life teaches you stuff. Not everybody apparently, but you certainly.""
 
 As many thanked Potter, some also felt compelled to extend an olive branch.
 
 Gottaluvit: ""As a predominantly Liberal voter I did not support Julia Gillard. However it has become clear to me, not least because of the dignity that she showed following the loss of the top job and what she has achieved since, that regardless of the fact that I did not agree with all her policies Australia lost one of its potentially great prime ministers. I cringed when Alan Jones said, unforgivably, that her father died of shame, but I said nothing. I said nothing in relation to the blatant gender discrimination and all the other crap they sent in her direction. I likewise offer my apologies, Ms Gillard.""
 
 But not all readers were as forgiving of Potter - rejecting her letter as ""too little, too late"" - or of the many others, including some in the media, who they believed treated Gillard unfairly.
 
 somanyworries: ""Well, it might have been brave if said back then.""
 
 Dave: ""You don't need to support the sisterhood. You can be political opponents, but what is required is everyone treats each other equally, fairly and respectfully and that did not happen for Julia Gillard.""
 
 The Owl and the Pussy Cat: ""I am sure the former PM is thrilled at your conversion. Thanks for the support when it mattered.""
 
 Gillard, however, did acknowledge Potter's piece, tweeting: ""Thank you for your letter ... We can't change the past but together women from all sides of politics and all walks of life can shape a gender-equal future.""
 
 Reading through reader comments, Potter says the response has been ""incredibly heartening and unexpectedly kind"".
 
 ""It is clear that our community is far more evolved on this issue - and ready for change - than some of our most senior politicians. In particular, Julia's exceedingly generous response sent a powerful message, especially to women, that these conversations are important and change is inevitable.
 
 ""It has ignited many conversations amongst Liberal voters and supporters. The expectations we have of our party are changing and I was pleased to see many reflect on their own attitudes 10 years ago.""
 
 While this is true of many, others were still quick to point fingers, saying both sides of politics had questions to answer on their treatment of women.
 
 Reader Chad wrote: ""Peta Credlin, I'd like to apologise to you also, for the way you were attacked and slandered during your time in office by the left, particularly by the media.""
 
 Smack, City of the Fallen replied: ""Shhh, we can't talk about that here, doesn't suit the narrative.""
 
 To those who remained cynical of Potter's motives in writing the apology, believing it might be self-serving, she says: ""Totally understandable, especially in politics, but I'm a disappointment in that case. I wrote it because I genuinely meant it.""

47,Herald Sun,News,2021-04-11T19:59:29.413Z,"Hopes rise for faster road out FINALLY, some good news for beleaguered Melburnians as the COVID infection curve heads sharply towards manageable numbers.
 
 Premier Daniel Andrews described Sunday as “cause for great optimism and positivity” as Melbourne recorded 14 new coronavirus cases overnight. It was the lowest daily increase since 13 cases were recorded on June 19 and now takes metropolitan Melbourne’s 14-day rolling average to 36.2 infections.
 
 With the second step in Melbourne’s road map to reopening due to be triggered next Sunday if the fortnightly average remains between 30 and 50, there should be a real possibility we could see faster moves to lifting the lockdown.
 
 Premier Andrews insisted any decisions on greater relaxation of social or work restrictions would be dictated by the data — not just the number but also the source of infections — but we appear, fingers crossed, to have turned a corner.
 
 “We’re confident that come (next) Sunday, we’ll be able to make some significant announcements because we’ll be in that 30 to 50 band,” Mr Andrews said.
 
 “Significant” at this point doesn’t mean any change from the road map script. The second step on the government’s road map, if the 30-50 average is met by September 28, allows for outdoor gatherings increased to up to five people from a maximum of two households; childcare and early education to reopen; the staged return to schools with onsite learning for prep to year 2, VCE/VCAL and specialist schools in term 4 and outdoor personal training allowed with up to two people per trainer, with outdoor pools to open.
 
 These are only minimal easings and were set in place when Melbourne University’s dynamic policy model, the analysis on which the road map was established, began mapping its forecasts on September 3 when there were 113 cases.
 
 But if the COVID trajectory continues on its strong path southward, and the number of mystery cases of unknown source keep falling (decreasing on Sunday by seven to 52), a faster route to reopening needs to be adopted.
 
 The third step, not due until October 26 and then only if there are less than five new cases in the fortnightly average and less than five cases of unknown source statewide, triggers a much greater easing.
 
 That stage sees the curfew end; no restrictions on reasons to leave home; outdoor gatherings increased to 10; five guests to a home; remote learning with potential staged return to schools for years 3-10 based on public health advice; outdoor seating service with up to 10 and density limits at cafes and restaurants; retail reopening and some easing on restrictions for travel, real estate and religious services.
 
 The Premier is right to maintain a single day of relatively low numbers doesn’t guarantee an uninterrupted trend. The supercomputer modelling the road map is based on shows wide reopening at 25 cases a day would still carry a 62 per cent likelihood of a resurgence in infections and a return to lockdowns before Christmas.
 
 But at five cases, that risk plummets to a 3 per cent chance. As revealed in today’s Herald Sun, leading epidemiologists believe we can reach the magic five in daily cases weeks ahead of the October 26 deadline — possibly as early as October 4 .
 
 And it is understood that if we reach those numbers, the government would look at shifting forward the October 26 deadline for bringing Melbourne out of lockdown.
 
 Mr Andrews should absolutely respond to the reality.
 
 There is definitely room for more aggressive easing if numbers aggressively fall.
 
 Melburnians have endured some of the world’s toughest and longest restrictions and deserve every break they can get.
 
 Domestic murder gap APPALLING rates of domestic violence and partner homicide have in recent years finally begun to receive the condemnation and attention required to forge change.
 
 For years, violence which erupted behind closed doors across the suburbs was somehow treated differently to other crime. In the past, it was considered a private, emotional implosion turned violent and into tragedy. A royal commission, reform to the avenues of support and the robust focus police and prosecutors now place on tackling domestic violence means we are changing perceptions and — hopefully — protections and outcomes. Yet, as reported in today’s Herald Sun, an analysis of 26 sentences for domestic and unrelated/random homicide shows an alarming disparity.
 
 In Victoria, men who kill women they know receive average minimum jail terms less than half of those who fatally attack random victims. The Andrews government has increased partner/ex-partner manslaughter maximums from 20 to 25 years. But the minimum term is where disparity is found and that requires the judiciary to better reflect community outrage at domestic abuse and fatalities by increasing base sentences for such heinous attacks.",809
48,IDEALISM IS HATRED IN DISGUISE,News,2021-01-02T18:01:45.010Z,"RACISM is just one way people can be cruel. Black Lives Matter supporters have shown us other ways — but their ways are apparently OK.
 
 Former broadcaster Mike Carlton, who this month won an Order of Australia, is a big supporter of the race protests: “So good to see this!” But this same Leftist wondered why another ABC panellist didn’t “leap from his seat and strangle” Liberal MP Nicole Flint, called commentator Daisy Cousens a “b----”, and last week abused Daily Telegraph writer Sharri Markson as a “lickspittle”, “halfwit” and “toady”.
 
 All this without a peep from the anti-racism protesters, social media activists or journalists who claimed to be incensed at milder criticisms of female prime ministers by conservative broadcaster Alan Jones.
 
 Carlton even infamously abused Jewish readers, telling one he was “the classic example of the Jewish bigot”, yet now brays that racism is bad, as if anti-Semitism doesn’t count.
 
 So, does kowtowing to Black Lives Matter, an essentially racist movement, wash away other sins? Does it even licence you to commit other forms of cruelty?
 
 Take NRL star John Hopoate, who last week claimed TV presenter Erin Molan, actually a lovely woman, had made a racist joke about hard-to-pronounce Polynesian names.
 
 It seems that to Hopoate, at least, Molan’s “racist” joke was an excuse to unleash weapons-grade sexism.
 
 He tweeted how he could also use a joke excuse should he “accidentally trip this RACIST B***H over and she falls and scrapes her RACIST mouth on the ground”.
 
 Worse is comedian Dave Chapelle.
 
 He has now released a rant on Netflix in which his supposed hatred of racism is his excuse for disgusting misogynistic abuse of black activist Candace Owens, who’d criticised protesters making a saint of George Floyd, killed by police in Minneapolis.
 
 “I don’t care if (Floyd) personally kicked Candace Owens in her stinky p----,” raged Chapelle. “I don’t know if it stinks, but I imagine it does.” What is extraordinary is that Netflix, so sensitive to “racism” that it even cancelled shows in which the brilliant Chris Lilley played characters in “brown-face”, ran Chappelle’s vilification in full.
 
 How right philosopher Bertrand Russell was: “Much that passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of power.” We’re seeing that now: Activists using their “anti-racism” to disguise their own savagery. Feeling good about doing bad.",411
49,IR package favours business flexibility,Fairfax,2020-06-07T01:14:57.164Z,"The government's industrial relations reform package being gradually unveiled this week promised much but has as yet delivered little. This is a lost opportunity. After more than a year of consultation including discussion papers, close collaboration with the ACTU during the height of the COVID crisis, and working groups with unions and employer associations, the proposed industrial relations changes largely ignore the big challenges of today.
 
 In 2019, when the Attorney-General started public consultation, the big industrial relations challenges facing the country included stagnant wage growth, growing inequality, persistent job insecurity, widespread wage theft particularly for temporary migrants, a large gender pay gap, and the gig economy's avoidance of the industrial relations system.
 
 From what we've seen so far, this week's proposed reforms appear underwhelming, failing to address these challenges. Instead, while vaguely justified as a response to COVID-related business needs, stimulating job creation, they look like a simple attempt to favour business flexibility.
 
 Industrial relations regulation has been called a pendulum, swinging between the goals of business flexibility and worker protections. However, the overwhelming consensus from decades of international research indicates that the most effective industrial relations systems achieve both goals.
 
 Previous Australian governments have adopted a mutual gains approach to industrial relations reform. The introduction of enterprise bargaining in 1993 was heralded as a system allowing employers and employees to negotiate arrangements that would accommodate the needs of both.
 
 The Morrison government's proposed reforms are modest. They do not appear to represent Work Choices 2.0. But if the Senate passes the proposals presented so far, it looks likely they will adversely impact workers in low-wage sectors.
 
 Extending flexible part-time work arrangements to all retail, restaurant, hospitality and licensed club employers without having to demonstrate hardship, as they must currently to gain these flexibilities under JobKeeper, could deliver considerable wage savings for employers. New greenfields agreements will allow some employers to lock in wage rates, setting long-term employment conditions before hiring any workers. And changes to casual employment arrangements may give greater certainty to business without addressing the known problem of misclassification.
 
 Criminal sanctions are to be introduced for the most serious cases of wage theft. But research tells us that this won't increase employer compliance. Missing is increased enforcement in the form of adequate resourcing the Fair Work Ombudsman, enabling unions to take a greater enforcement role, and reducing worker vulnerability through migration reform.
 
 Job creation is a stated objective of the proposals. While this is undoubtedly critical during a recession, a greater focus of creating good-quality jobs would help to ensure that the recovery is sustainable rather than short-lived. As the OECD emphasises, addressing income inequality and job insecurity are critical for creating good quality jobs. Why, then, has the government chosen to simulate hospitality and retail with increased flexibility at the expense of worker protection?
 
 These industries are characterised by poor job quality, as seen in the prevalence of insecure work, low wages and wage theft. By removing some of the protective floor and failing to better enforce wage laws, these reforms may drive down the price of labour. But this may come at the expense of creating good-quality jobs and increasing productivity.
 
 The Fair Work Act is far from perfect. But reforms should have greater vision and deliver more than shifting the regulatory pendulum in favour of businesses.

50,It's time for a royal commission,Others,2021-09-30T04:38:40.741Z,"Want to address domestic violence? Don't mourn this latest committee. Let's do something big.
 
 I wrote my first story about domestic violence in 1979. About three months ago, I thought I'd written my last. When Hannah Clarke and her three children, Aaliyah, Laianah, and Trey, were murdered by her former partner, the prevalence and pain of Australia's domestic violence epidemic roared across our country. So many soundbites, so many stories, so many politicians saying never again. So many people saying the same thing over and over again. So much rage.
 
 Hannah Clarke was the eighth woman to be killed this year. Now it's 21 - seven women since May 3.
 
 To mark these 21 deaths, a dogfight broke out over a parliamentary inquiry into domestic violence this week. A Senate inquiry into domestic and family violence, established in the wake of the murders of Hannah Clarke and her children, was shut down without a single public hearing, and without seeking any submissions.
 
 Does that matter? The fact that it was set up in the shadow of the murders of Clarke and her children makes this inquiry meaningful to ordinary Australians. It looks as if we are trying to do something, anything at all.
 
 This inquiry was set up under the aegis of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee References Committee, and its terms of reference were specific. Those terms noted there had already been a number of inquiries relating to domestic violence. So, so many. The most poignant part of the terms of reference was that it would deliver a report by August 13 this year. That report has now been delivered three months early. This month, August, no difference really. It's hard to see how these inquiries can make substantial change.
 
 I really understand the mass outpouring of anguish. I understand Senator Rex Patrick's fury. This particular inquiry was his idea, he championed its formation in the Senate on February 26, he devised the terms of reference - but he wasn't a member of the inquiry. He says the early report is unprecedented for a Senate inquiry and released dissenting comments which said the inquiry ""failed in its duty in the shadow of the most horrific recent incidence of domestic violence, the death of Hannah Clarke and her three children"".
 
 ""Instead of making substantive recommendations for action, the committee has merely posed questions. The committee members squibbed this completely,"" Senator Patrick said.
 
 The problem is, we have all squibbed this completely. The way we approach this, time after time, is all wrong. And politicians do it in the heat of the moment - I understand that. Let's act now. Let's do something. A mother and her children, murdered in front of everyone. Let's have an inquiry. Let's throw some more money somewhere. Let's talk.
 
 I'm personally sick of talk. We all want an end to domestic and family violence. And I'm desperately sorry that this was the inquiry which came to an early end, instead of the pointless Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System. You'll remember this particular committee. It was basically set up as a response to Pauline Hanson's ludicrous view that the Family Court discriminates against men. Hanson's taken up the flag of the men's rights movement, because she will dance with any derangement. And you'll remember that the inquiry was set up even though the Australian Law Reform Commission had already made recommendations after its own review.
 
 The first week of the Hanson inquiry was a shitshow, dominated by those making unsubstantiated claims, including that women lie about domestic violence.
 
 Last year, the Law Council of Australia called for the inquiry to be abandoned after One Nation livestreamed hearings and allowed comments about witnesses. You can only imagine what they were saying. This week the Law Council is expressing regret that this latest inquiry has been cancelled.
 
 I asked Claire Chandler, the Tasmanian Liberal senator who is on that committee, whether this particular inquiry had a broader approach. Her spokesperson wrote:
 
 ""Domestic Violence is a serious issue, and one which the Parliament treats with the upmost importance.
 
 ""The Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System is currently looking into the family law system, which is inextricably linked to the issue of family and domestic violence in Australia. The publicly available terms of reference, and the publicly available submissions, indicate that domestic violence issues will be considered extensively. A number of public hearings have been held already around the country.
 
 ""Without wanting to pre-empt the findings of the Committee, I am certain that the Committee's work will be highly relevant to the issue of domestic violence.""
 
 So careful I could cry.
 
 No one is making this right for the women and children of Australia. The closest we've come is in Victoria, where former judge Marcia Neave oversaw a well-resourced royal commission. I remember she was sceptical it would ever work. But in the end the Victorian government agreed to all 227 recommendations. Her commission made that possible. It made family violence real and present in the public eye.
 
 Alison Macdonald, the acting chief executive officer of Domestic Violence Victoria, says that the most recent inquiry was barely visible. And she says that the Neave royal commission gave us an insight into what needed to be done and how. Early intervention, primary prevention, well-resourced recovery programs. We know that perpetrators need to be made accountable both institutionally and socially. We know that family violence is everyone's responsibility. We also know that stopping it will take vast generational change. We know that this all takes a lot of money and a real desire to make change.
 
 If we want change, we don't need one more review or inquiry. Follow Victoria's lead. Have a national royal commission. Let survivors tell their stories. Let experts share their success.
 
 Ditch the Hanson inquiry. Don't grieve for this most recent committee. Do something big.
 
 Let's remember Senator Amanda Stoker's words after the murder of Hannah Clarke and her children. She said: ""We won't forget Hannah and we won't forget her kids. We won't give up on making this right.""
 
 A royal commission might go some way to making that possible.

51,Job path is an uphill struggle,Fairfax,2020-06-06T16:30:27.689Z,"The PM is masterfully noncommittal on a plan to help the young who the coronacession will hit hardest.
 
 When Scott Morrison spoke to the first day of the National Youth Commission's virtual ""youth futures summit"" on Monday, he sought to assure the young people that, difficult as the pandemic and the economy are at the moment, there is another side to it, ""where Australia emerges once again, where we actually do go back to the life that we loved"".
 
 I'm sure that's true. But if past recessions are any guide, most of us will have recovered from the coronacession and be back enjoying the life we love long before most of the present crop of youngsters leaving education have found themselves a decent job.
 
 If the past is any guide, the government won't do nearly as much as it should to help those youngsters who, ""through no fault of their own"", as Morrison would say, had the immense misfortune to be born in the wrong year or three.
 
 And, quite apart from the pain so many young people will suffer, the money the taxpayer saves from that neglect is likely to be exceeded by all the subsequent cost to the budget in healthcare, unemployment benefits and workers whose reduced incomes mean they don't pay as much tax as they might have.
 
 The greatest burden of recessions always falls on the young for the simple reason that employers' automatic response to a recession is to cancel their annual intake of school and university leavers. The deeper the recession and the slower the recovery from it, the more years that entry-level hiring is postponed.
 
 This was the case for many years after the global financial crisis of 2008 even though, for the rest of us, a recession was avoided.
 
 You've heard that, unusually in this recession, the greatest burden has fallen on women rather than men. But this can be true while it remains true that the young are the greatest losers. That's because a disproportionate share of the women is young.
 
 As summarised for the summit by the independent economist Saul Eslake, research by Treasury has found that people who enter the job market for the first time during a recession are less likely to change jobs - which means they're more likely to miss out on one of the main ways by which people get pay rises during their first 10 years in the workforce (that is, changing jobs).
 
 This matters because almost 80 per cent of lifetime wage rises occur during the first 10 years of someone's working life. So the ""scarring"" effect of leaving education in a bad year lasts for 10 years.
 
 Treasury finds that the scarring effect has been bigger since 2000 than in earlier recessions, so the most recent generations of young people have been affected more than previous generations. And it's worse for women than for men.
 
 All this is consistent with the interim findings of a nationwide inquiry into youths' transition from education to employment, which the National Youth Commission published on Monday. It finds that unemployment for 15 to 24-year-olds is consistently higher than for 25 to 64-year-olds. And that traditional pathways to employment for young people have eroded over the past couple of decades.
 
 One thing that's changed over the years is the growth of underemployment. To the present unemployment rate of 7.5 per cent and rising must be added the underemployment rate of 11.2 per cent, representing those who have some paid work but want more.
 
 Just remember it's the young who dominate the underemployed. Many of them have multiple jobs, but still can't make ends meet. Many are in the ""gig economy"", whom governments have allowed to be defined as ""independent contractors"", thus permitting those wonderful innovative outfits that run app-based fast-food delivery and all the rest to sidestep the legal obligations of an employer.
 
 Remember, too, that the seeming epidemic of ""wage theft"" - which, by their neglect, governments have done too much to allow and too little stamp out - would be perpetrated particularly on the young.
 
 Unsurprisingly, the inquiry found the (pre-pandemic) levels of the youth allowance and unemployment benefits - which successive governments have frozen in real terms for 25 years - are inadequate. It's the young who suffer most from this parsimony.
 
 Morrison and his ministers have repeatedly defended the $40 a day by saying people are on the dole only temporarily before they find a job. That was certainly the reasonable expectation in the past. Now, however, it's one of the respects in which the inquiry found the system no long fit for purpose.
 
 Another respect is, it's no longer true that most jobs for young people are full-time. Only in the past month has the government temporarily changed the means test to encourage the unemployed to look for part-time jobs. Pity so few of them are on offer at the minute.
 
 The youth commission has proposed a detailed ""youth futures guarantee"" laying out reforms and measures that would better support our young people in meeting the challenges they face. Challenged to respond to the proposal, Morrison was masterfully noncommittal.

52,Jobless sole parents face cash crux,Fairfax,2021-06-13T08:07:46.176Z,"Unemployed single parents are facing a higher risk of hardship as pandemic support tapers off.
 
 Poverty shock is looming for single parents who lost their jobs during the pandemic when the government starts winding back its coronavirus payments later this week.
 
 Single parents account for one in eight Australian families and they are more likely to be out of work in this recession. For those who have lost work during the pandemic, free childcare and the Coronavirus Supplement initially cushioned the blow.
 
 But free childcare ended in July and the Coronavirus Supplement - an extra payment to recipients of unemployment benefits and pensions as part of the federal government's economic stimulus - is due to drop from $550 to $250 a fortnight from September 25.
 
 The single-parent pension, aka the Parenting Payment, is about $790 a fortnight without the supplement.
 
 A Gillard-era policy means single parents of children over the age of eight receive JobSeeker of $612 a fortnight rather than the pension. The Coronavirus Supplement is the same for both groups.
 
 From all reports, the extra $550 has been well used. The Herald reported last week about the transformative effect for single parents who previously struggled to put fresh food on the table and sometimes took risks out of desperation such as shoplifting or remaining with abusive partners.
 
 I've crunched the numbers to try to see what the reduction from $550 to $250 will mean for families.
 
 For single parents who were on the full pension of $790 a fortnight before the pandemic, most will still be better off than pre-COVID-19. That's because to receive the full pension, employment income is capped at $192.60 a fortnight plus $24.60 for each additional child. You would need three children in order to earn $250 a fortnight and keep the full pension. But for single parents who combined a part-time job with a part pension before the pandemic and then lost work because of COVID-19, this could be the moment that plunges them into serious hardship.
 
 The reason, as Jenny Davidson from the Council of Single Mothers and their Children says, is because they don't know the survival techniques used by long-time pensioners ""like finding the cheapest cuts of meat"" to save money.
 
  Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released in August show the unemployment rate for lone parents with children under the age of 15 was 10 per cent in July, compared with the national unemployment rate of 7.6 per cent. (The national unemployment figure for August declined to 6.8 per cent but the latest figures for lone parents are yet to be published).
 
 The unemployment rate for lone parents is slightly higher than before the pandemic, while the workforce participation rate for this group declined from 68.5 per cent in February to 66.3 per cent in July. This indicates many single parents are not working but not actively looking for a job because of the tough job market or changed caring responsibilities.
 
 The ABS says four out of five single-parent families are headed by women, though single-father households are growing in number. A third of single mothers and their children live in poverty, according to UNSW.
 
 My analysis shows if a single parent of two children under the age of 8 lost a job with a gross salary of $1000 a fortnight, the loss of employment income was initially fully offset by increased benefits and free childcare.
 
 The person's disposable income before the pandemic was $880 a fortnight based on the employment income, plus $488 part pension (Parenting Payment) and $704 Family Tax Benefit A and B and Rent Assistance, but after paying tax, rent and childcare fees.
 
 Without the job but with full Parenting Payment and the special pandemic provisions of Coronavirus Supplement and free childcare, the person's disposable income rose to $992 a fortnight. The model assumes one child in after-school care and one in long daycare for two days a week each and weekly rent of $500 based on the Sydney median. It assumes they are not eligible for JobKeeper and do not receive child support.
 
 However, the return of the Child Care Subsidy and fees on July 12 meant a 30 per cent decline in disposable income to $691 a fortnight if they maintained childcare days. From September 25, the lower supplement will mean a further 35 per cent decline in disposable income to $448 a fortnight.
 
 Many parents would try to maintain childcare arrangements after losing a job to enable them to look for work and accept a job and for the proven education and socialisation benefits especially for children of preschool age.
 
 Davidson is expecting a rush on emergency relief systems. ""A lot of families will go into sort of a poverty shock because they've not previously experienced it,"" she says.
 
 Most people don't set out to become single parents or unemployed during a pandemic but if there's anything 2020 has taught us it's that life doesn't always work out the way you plan. The government reportedly has more economic stimulus in mind; ensuring more families don't fall into poverty would be a good place to start.

53,Make visible to justice women's hidden hell,Fairfax,2021-07-17T03:23:39.105Z,"Anyone who thinks the abuse of women isn't baked into our culture need only sit back and listen closely to a few of our greatest hits. Take the jaunty Working my Way Back to You Babe, by the Spinners (yes, after the Four Seasons). The lyrics reveal a classic case of a lying, cheating emotional abuser trying to claw his way back into his partner's affections: ""I used to love to make you cry. It made me feel like a man inside.""
 
 Then there's Pink Floyd's Don't Leave Me Now: ""I need you, babe, to put through the shredder in front of my friends ... To beat to a pulp on Saturday night."" And what about the menacing song written by John Lennon - whose record of beating his wife Cynthia seems to have been virtually erased from history. In Run for Your Life a jealous man threatens a woman: ""I'd rather see you dead, little girl / than to be with another man."" Problem is, the women often do end up dead.
 
 And one of the greatest predictors of homicide is not bruises, broken limbs or smashed furniture. It's controlling behaviour, the kind invisible to the justice system, the kind a majority of domestic abuse victims experience. The kind that in all states and territories except Tasmania is perfectly legal. Which means that the most dangerous form of domestic abuse is not a crime in mainland Australia.
 
 But now in NSW some momentum is beginning to build to criminalise coercive control, as has now been done throughout Britain. This week, the ABC's Stephanie Boltje broke the story that the NSW Opposition is planning to introduce a private member's bill next week with jail terms of five years for coercive control - and 10 years for ""aggravated coercive control"" that involves, or was witnessed by, children. For the shadow minister for the prevention of domestic violence, Trish Doyle, ""it's personal"" - in her first speech to Parliament she revealed how she lay in her bed as an 8-year-old quaking with terror listening to gunshots ringing in her house, and lived in an orphanage as she waited for her mother to recover from ""severe beating and internal hemorrhaging"".
 
 In short, the legislation is needed because currently the policing of perpetrators of domestic violence is centred on ""incidents"" - assaults or damaging of property, not of long-term patterns of abusive behaviour.
 
 Coercive control is about ""systems"" of behaviour that men can use to dominate women (and it is almost always women who are victims), stripping them of freedom, subjecting them to severe rules that they are punished for breaching, micromanaging their behaviour, monitoring their movements and social media activities, humiliating and degrading them, depriving them of self-esteem and dignity, and threatening to kill pets, children or people they love if they are not compliant. It can push women to doubt themselves and their sanity. It's hell.
 
 As NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman described it, it is a ""form of slavery"". It is behaviour that sits at the heart of family violence. And it is chillingly common. According to a NSW Coroner's review of intimate partner homicides, before murdering their partners 99 per cent of perpetrators displayed ""coercive and controlling behaviours towards
 
 the victim"".
 
 Research has found 60 to 80 per cent of women who seek help for abuse have experienced coercive control. (When the Australian Institute of Criminology surveyed 15,000 women, almost 6 per cent reported having experienced this during the period of the pandemic, many for the first time.)
 
 Speakman has said he has ""no immediate plans"" to bring in new laws but is currently investigating the ways coercive control has worked in other jurisdictions, particularly in Scotland, which were introduced after those in England and Wales and are considered the ""gold standard"". The initial signs are encouraging: in its first year, 1000 charges were laid and 96 per cent of those were prosecuted.
 
 What we would need to do to ensure laws like this are effective is to ensure community and policing attitudes shift and a true understanding of the dangers and prevalence of coercive control is developed so that people become aware that obsessive, jealous behaviour is not romantic but ugly. And to recognise that these are the kinds of behaviours Hannah Clarke was enduring before she and her three children were murdered in Brisbane in February.
 
 There is a defence under this proposed legislation, too, that says people won't be sanctioned just for ""unreasonable behaviour"". People may well have outbursts, bad days, make stupid mistakes. What these laws are about is capturing far more pernicious, pervasive and potentially fatal behaviours.
 
 There is doubtless a period of consultation ahead. As journalist and author of the award-winning book See What You Made Me Do, Jess Hill, has cautioned, the wording and drafting of these laws will be crucial to their success. Speakman told the ABC there was ""multipartisan support"" for legislation, from the NSW Greens, the NSW Liberal Women's Council, the Queensland nationals. And the momentum is growing.
 
 This week Shellharbour Labor MP Anna Watson - who has been deeply involved with the survivors of domestic abuse and their families in her electorate and is passionate about addressing it - will be introducing coercive control legislation into NSW Parliament as a private members bill. On Thursday, she wrote to NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urging her to take the issue to national cabinet.
 
 Speakman says he has been speaking to Scottish and English prosecutors, has started ""initial discussions"" with police and ""will be ramping up that investigation and consultation in the next few months"".
 
 So let's keep a close eye on this ramping. The Attorney-General is correct to say these laws cannot be rushed. But nor should they be unnecessarily delayed. Eighteen-year-old Daniel Christie died 11 days after being punched on a night out in King's Cross on New Year's Eve 2013. Less than a month later, NSW Parliament had introduced eight-year prison terms for anyone who fatally punched anyone while drunk or high. A matter of weeks.
 
 Meanwhile, on average, every few days one woman dies at the hands of her partner in this country. Surely we don't have time to twiddle our thumbs.

54,Male champions with an image problem,Fairfax,2020-06-16T23:26:13.250Z,"Male Champions of Change has a problem. Ten years after its inception and at the end of its first major review, the organisation is now facing the biggest challenge of its existence.
 
 That challenge is not Boe Pahari. Pahari is the chief executive of AMP Capital, appointed with sullen disregard for his colleagues, men and women; a high-performing executive fined after a sexual harassment complaint. Adam Tindall, Pahari's predecessor, was a keen participant in Male Champions of Change and signed its last impact report. Pahari, clearly reflective, has not approached MCC for membership. Or, as one MCC insider said: ""Adam resigned. Doesn't mean the other dude is coming in."" Yet.
 
 The Pahari debacle has brought renewed focus on the Male Champions of Change and its role. But here's its real challenge. At the end of its review, the stakeholders had some feedback - the name had to go. Specifically, the word ""male"". The goals were sound but the name made it look as if men were being elevated in the battle for equality. Surely men didn't need more of a boost, said MCC's stakeholders, ranging across organisations and sectors.But if it removes the word male from its title, what's left? Another organisation promoting diversity, equality, multi-something, without any real difference or effect. More pink-washing.
 
 One of the challenges facing organisations like this is the impossibility of due diligence on its members. Like White Ribbon, there is no transparency when appointing men to its ranks. You could be a prize misogynist behind closed doors and still be an MCC in public. Rightly, there are membership hurdles: signatories are required to report gender data annually; sign the pledge not to sit on men-only panels; recognise domestic violence as a workplace issue; attend 75 per cent of MCC meetings; and have an implementation plan. All worthy.
 
 Australia has a government-funded champion of change, the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, or WGEA, which makes nearly all its data available and gives citations to organisations appearing to do a good job. The focus is on, among other things, developing a gender-balanced workforce; gender pay equity; mainstreaming flexible work; preventing gender-based harassment and discrimination; and ending sexual harassment and bullying. No individual gets special endorsement. Organisations fall off the agency's list.
 
 No man has ever been sacked as a Male Champion of Change. Those on the MCC list haven't all signed up for the agency's scrutiny: Michael Spence, outgoing vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney is a Male Champion of Change, but the University of Sydney doesn't have a WGEA citation; Alan Joyce is on the MCC list but Qantas is absent from the list, as is the Commonwealth Bank whose chief executive Matt Comyn has signed up as an MCC. Many sporting bodies signed up to MCC. The AFL was a WGEA Employer of Choice in 2018-2019 but didn't apply for 2019 -2020. MCC members must have an implementation plan - that's where the real work gets done. In the 2019 MCC impact report, there were 281 implementation leaders, more than 70 per cent were unnamed women. Of four key goals, none is at a 100 per cent. The gender balance in key personnel since MCC benchmarking is at a lamentable 63 per cent.
 
 General principles for those who want change: put enforceable quotas in place; ban non-disclosure agreements where the acts instigating those agreements could be breaches of the law, including sexual harassment and discrimination; force all companies to cough up their gender data and change the legislation that governs WGEA to make an individual company's gender pay gap public; give women credit for everything they do to make work a better place and make men responsible for fixing the mess they've made. No more rewards, just results.

55,Migrant workers deserve state support,Fairfax,2021-10-13T13:51:23.206Z,"This pandemic has put some existing inequalities into sharp relief. Maybe I notice this more than others because of my background, but it is also precisely because of my background - what I look like, my Chinese surname and my Chinese Malaysian heritage - that I feel I must point it out.
 
 In my workplace, the NSW Parliament, most of the people who look like me - and those who reflect the diversity of our community - are actually not those sitting in the chamber; they are working behind the scenes, serving the food, cleaning the offices and keeping things moving.
 
 It is hard to ignore that while many of us work from home to avoid contact with COVID-19, almost everyone riding a bike with a branded delivery box on their back or restocking the shelves at the supermarket is a person of colour.
 
 It is hard to not think about racial privilege when you see which workers got to disembark the Ruby Princess and fly back home and which workers were left - sick, stranded, forced to return home on the ship itself.
 
 And it is hard to not take it as anything other than racial discrimination when Australians who were flown home from China in February were quarantined on Christmas Island, while those returning from other countries later in the pandemic were put up in city hotels and serviced apartments.
 
 While the virus does not discriminate, the measures and protections you are afforded to keep you safe right now and the support you receive are absolutely determined by the colour of your passport or the status of your visa.
 
 International students and backpackers now find themselves relying on handouts of food.
 
 NSW has the highest number of temporary visa holders and international students in the country, yet these people have been left out of support measures. Unlike Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT, the NSW government hasn't committed anything to assist these people, beyond protection from eviction and legal and mental health support.
 
 Reports are starting to grow of migrant women having their safety put at risk as a result of the lack of support. There are countless stories of people who have made their home in this country for decades, who have been paying taxes and contributing to their communities, who now find themselves out of work and unable to provide for their family, with no government support.
 
 Migrants are more than just a resource to be used to boost the economy or improve quality of life for Australians, only to be forgotten when they are no longer needed. People who are living in our communities on temporary visas have the right to be treated equally, with dignity and respect. They are our families, our friends, our loved ones. They are our community.
 
 The idea that now would be the time to advocate for the protection of Australian jobs first, to embrace that sense of nationalism, is hugely concerning. Now is not the time for making some arbitrary distinction between who deserves jobs and who doesn't, based on the lottery of where we happen to have been born. This is a global pandemic and we need a global, humanitarian and human rights-based response.
 
 If there was ever a time to offer a hand to migrants and their families who need a share of our wealth and privilege, then surely it is now. This crisis gives us an opportunity to reset some of the inequality that has for too long been woven into the fabric of this country. Let us hope that we choose to take it up.

Why, for someone who regularly writes about her life, did this feel an expose too far?
 
 I am entitled to that part-pension. I take issue with federal Minister for Social Services Anne Ruston, who last year told a radio host: ""It is a generous amount of money that the Australian taxpayers make available to our older Australians.""
 
 The age pension is neither generous nor a gift from a benevolent government. It is my right, an entitlement financed by my more than four decades of taxes. But this week I realised that with a single text Centrelink had changed my status from one I was proud of, to that of an old person, a state dependent, someone whom society does not take seriously and cares less about than younger Australians.
 
 I've always been proud to say I was a journalist, and still am. I've held senior positions in three countries - though it wasn't until I became an academic that my father thought I had a real job. Both jobs carry a certain status. But pensioner - that's just someone with grey hair, free weekend public transport and complaints about utility bills, isn't it? The butt of bad jokes in old British comedies, thrown a few crumbs at election time ...
 
 My one-income-household working life has enabled me to acquire a freehold house and some superannuation, although not enough to self-fund my retirement. But claiming a pension should not, overnight, make me some kind of second-class citizen. Nor should it for the 72 per cent of age-eligible retirees who get some portion of the age pension, while 42 per cent receive a full pension - a proportion that peaks at age 80, according to 2018 Challenger research.
 
 Many of that group will struggle for the rest of their lives to live on it. How many will have no holiday in 2020, as pandemic restrictions curtail accommodation discounts and free V/Line trains during October's Seniors Week?
 
 Single women age pensioners who rent are most likely to experience housing stress and live in poverty, Federal Parliament's Economic Security for Women in Retirement inquiry heard. Its report, A Husband Is Not a Retirement Plan, noted the importance of the age pension in providing economic security for women. They are more likely to rely on it in retirement because lower lifetime earnings mean lower superannuation balances.
 
 Generally, we don't value older people in our society. It's hardly news that there's age discrimination in Australia, despite laws against it. Just ask someone over 50 trying to get a job. Listen to those challenged about their failure to comply with pandemic restrictions or who suggest herd immunity as a strategy: ""only"" old people are dying. The clear message: our lives are worth less.
 
 It's gratifying that The Age's Loved & Lost series, ""in memory and celebration"" of those who have died in the pandemic, is ensuring they don't pass unnoticed except by those who knew and loved them. That they are not ""only"" another deceased old person. Their stories are inspiring, moving, amusing, educational as we read of the rich and well-lived lives of those who, too often in our fast-paced news cycle, are dismissed as ""a resident of aged care"" or ""a woman in her 70s, or 80s, or 90s"".
 
 I'm not embarrassed about getting old. My age is not a secret. I'm not embarrassed about receiving a part-pension. But I'm pleased and grateful that I'm still being published, that when someone asks, ""What do you do?"" I can say I'm a journalist and not mention the P-word. I've no intention of meekly accepting a label that suggests I'm now a lesser person, that my life has less meaning, and go quietly into some good night.

57,Patching over a culture problem,Fairfax,2020-09-17T08:30:50.634Z,"Morrison must lead the charge and work with Labor to fix the entrenched sexism that plagues Australian politics.
 
 Since ABC's Four Corners broadcast an episode exploring entrenched sexism in Parliament House, and more specifically within the Liberal Party, male politicians have said very, very, very little about it.
 
 Ordinarily, the task of a columnist is to be topical. The episode in question was broadcast three weeks ago. It's old news. But in this case that's the point: every time the issue of sexism in Canberra is raised, it's quickly rushed past, then forgotten (by men). Nothing happens.
 
 The conversations I had immediately after the episode aired were divided (several women have noted this too). The men - yep, this is a generalisation, you'll live - tended to say, ""Well, where's the smoking gun?"" They focused on the possibility of individual resignations, and, when these seemed unlikely, decided there wasn't much to see.
 
 The women were more likely to view the program as a whole - the second half dealt with individuals while the first dealt with broader issues - and say, ""We've seen this show before, and when women are saying these types of things about a workplace, then that's the tip of the iceberg: the culture is rotten.""
 
 This isn't surprising. It happens in every environment: those who are not adversely affected by a situation are less likely to think the situation is a problem. So it wasn't surprising, either, when the Prime Minister, in his comments immediately afterwards, barely touched on the broader culture. Instead, he focused on saying his ministers hadn't committed a sacking offence; that the ban on sex between ministers and their staff was good; on the principle (noble, but hopelessly vague) that everyone should feel comfortable in their workplace; and the fact that Four Corners hadn't spent more time on Labor.
 
 Each of these is at least arguable, and we could spend time arguing over them, except that this is what always happens. Someone finds a way to drag us into another debate, as we miss yet another opportunity to debate the actual thing that matters, which is the sexism. Some former female staffers knew the moment they saw the show that nothing would happen, because there wasn't a crime at its centre. (Of course, if there had been a crime at its centre, this would have become an excuse as well, to ignore everything except the crime.)
 
 This is awful, because the issues around sex itself, while hugely significant, are only one part of an intractable problem in both state and federal politics. Female staff are often treated with less respect. There are blokes' clubs, and blokes' jokes. There's no pathway back after pregnancy; women with children are asked why they aren't looking after their kids. They are overlooked for jobs they clearly deserve. These things happen everywhere, but women are often surprised when they leave politics to work in business at just how much they had to put up with.
 
 I have been struck by the reporting on the atrocities alleged to have been committed by our troops in Afghanistan: specifically, by the suggestion that the rotten culture had been there for some time. There were warning signs; those signs were not given sufficient attention. And I was interested, too, in the Prime Minister's comments last week that there should be accountability not only for individual acts, but also for those in the chain of command who had responsibility.
 
 I am comparing very different things, but there are three features in common. First, institutional culture is very difficult to change. Second, when a culture is left to fester, a disaster, eventually, is inevitable. The third is precisely what the Prime Minister implied: a culture cannot be fixed at an individual level. Change must come from the top.
 
 It is likely Scott Morrison thinks he is delivering just that by saying that his ministers know his standards. But we are not talking only about ministers; nor are we only talking about the narrow rule involving ministers and their staff.
 
 The idea that Morrison is some mystical leader who can change entire cultures by his mere presence ignores the way that culture works. He is no doubt right when he says there are similar issues in Labor (though Labor has done a much better job of increasing its number of female MPs). But if there are similar issues on both sides - and there are - then the answer isn't to say, ""We all do it, let's leave it alone."" It means the parties should work together to fix the problem, in all its forms.
 
 Morrison could do this. He has more women in his cabinet than any previous prime minister. When a preselection for a byelection came up early in his first term, he backed a woman. While he has been leader, the Liberal Party has adopted a new code of conduct (though it has been severely criticised). Acting in any meaningful way, though, would risk upsetting his colleagues, something that, for all the talk of his authority in the party, he reflexively avoids.
 
 Nothing I've said here is original. Women have made these points for years - like those who featured on Four Corners, as well as my former colleagues Maggie Lloyd and Fiona Sugden, or journalist Angela Pippos. A man leads the Liberal Party, and a man leads the Labor Party. It's time for them to listen and act.

58,Paternity leave a path to equality,Fairfax,2021-11-17T17:26:34.672Z,"The most direct way to achieve progress is to equally distribute the responsibility for childcare.
 
 The findings of sexual harassment against former judge Dyson Heydon by an independent investigation commissioned by the High Court have provoked a wave of new inquiries and proposals for reform.
 
 One of the first out of the blocks was Attorney-General Christian Porter ordering a further investigation into allegations that Heydon engaged in sexual harassment while presiding over the trade union royal commission in 2014.
 
 On July 12, the Victorian government announced two inquiries. The first is targeted at improving the workplace culture in Victoria's courts and tribunals; the second will look at the policies and practices of law firms that provide legal services to the Victorian government.
 
 Meanwhile, other courts and tribunals are promising bold changes to enhance the accountability of judges and tribunal members. There are many other voices adding calls for law reform and stronger workplace policies.
 
 Others have called for a new public regulator to enforce sexual harassment laws, echoing a recommendation made following a national inquiry into sexual harassment by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner in May. While much of this activity is well intentioned, it is likely to fail or at the very least not make much of a difference.
 
 Laws against sexual harassment have been with us for 40 years. State-of-the-art workplace policies and procedures about sexual harassment were introduced into workplaces at least two decades ago. They have not stamped out sexual harassment and nor will they do so.
 
 David Jones had one of the most exemplary policies when its then-chief executive, Mark McInnes, departed after allegations of sex harassment, which he denied. Even more recently, AMP has been defending the indefensible after promoting a senior employee to a chief executive role shortly after he was accused of sexually harassing a female staff member.
 
 The victim of the sexual harassment left the company. AMP had terrific policies and processes when all this happened.
 
 Addressing sexual harassment means recognising that it is a structural practice that reflects gender inequality.
 
 Tackling gender inequality requires us to change the relationships between men and women both at work and outside work.
 
 Policies and laws that reduce gender inequality will reduce the incidence of sexual harassment.
 
 The most direct route to achieve progress is to more equally distribute the responsibility for childcare between men and women.
 
 Mandating six months of paternity leave for Australian fathers would make a quantum leap towards gender equality because it would reduce the disadvantages experienced by women in the workforce - including the substantial interruption to income and career advancement after childbirth.
 
 Enlightened paternity leave schemes exist in Sweden, Germany, Finland and Norway. It is no coincidence that these countries rank in the top 10 on the global index for gender equality. Australian men are entitled to two weeks of paternity leave - paid at the minimum wage. It's pathetic, but arguably an accurate reflection of what most men think of the prospect of spending six months caring for a baby.
 
 Which brings me to the birth of my second child on April 28, 2006. On that day, I was having breakfast with my wife when her waters broke. We grabbed the essentials and made our way to the hospital.
 
 As we yabbered away nervously in the ward where just four hours later my wife would give birth, I flipped through newspapers and magazines, landing on a profile of the then-chief justice of the High Court, Murray Gleeson. The second paragraph read: ""Murray Gleeson was on his feet in court when his first child, Jacqueline, was born. He only learnt of the birth when Caltex, for whom he was appearing in the Federal Industrial Court, sent a telegram from its Sydney office.""
 
 Gleeson was the chief justice of the court during Heydon's tenure and has maintained a stoic silence since the sexual harassment scandal was revealed. His oldest child is now a Federal Court judge. Perhaps when she was born it was not uncommon for fathers to continue working during childbirth. When my children were born, it was rare for fathers to take extended paternity leave. I did not buck that orthodoxy.
 
 That orthodoxy must change but we should not underestimate how difficult such change will be. As #MeToo has demonstrated, real political change is not driven by company boardrooms or male ambassador programs. If you want change that redistributes power, you have to fight for it.

59,Religious freedom bill a nightmare for employers,Fairfax,2021-07-06T09:05:48.778Z,"One Nation's Anti-Discrimination Amendment (Religious Freedoms and Equality) Bill 2020 gets one thing right — the lack of protection for religious belief is a genuine gap in NSW anti-discrimination law.
 
 But when it comes to the detail, the bill not only goes the wrong way about introducing these much-needed protections, it represents a serious threat to the rights of all people in NSW.
 
 The problem arises because of the prioritisation of religious beliefs over the rights of others. Privileges would be provided to schools and charities and even some commercial businesses to discriminate against others, including people of minority faiths or those of no faith.
 
 To see what this will mean in practice, we can look to one of the many examples provided in the explanatory notes which One Nation state leader Mark Latham has urged us to read to obtain a ""full understanding of what the bill is trying to achieve"".
 
 The notes provide: ""A Satanist requests that a publisher print materials that promote the teachings of Satanism. A Jewish employee of the publisher requests that she not be required to facilitate the order ...""
 
 How would the bill resolve this issue? According to the notes, the employer cannot require the employee to undertake the task if another employee can do the work or ""where alternative publishers are reasonably available to facilitate the order"".
 
 In other words, an employee can refuse to perform the core component of their role, solely on the basis of their personal religious beliefs, even if this means sending the job to a competitor.
 
 This would allow employees to veto their employer's decisions, including what goods and services are offered and to whom.
 
 And what of the customer? They are turned away by the publisher because their religious belief does not accord with that of the employee, which is surely the type of discrimination that should be prohibited under a genuine religious discrimination bill.
 
 It's important also to get a sense of how far this would go. If this is how the bill is intended to operate, employees may refuse to provide goods or services to a wide range of people because of the employee's religious beliefs: not just to people from different religions, or no religion, but to single parents, unmarried couples, women, people with disability and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex people, among others.
 
 The customer has no way of knowing in advance whether a particular business will refuse to serve them. Based on the scenario set out in the explanatory notes, any business could turn away any customer based on the religious beliefs of an individual worker. That is a recipe for chaos.
 
 And it will leave employers in an invidious position: either they compel their employee to perform the requirements of their job and risk the employee claiming discrimination on the basis of religious belief, or they refuse to provide goods and services to customers on the basis of who they are and guarantee not just loss of income, but risk a discrimination complaint from the customer.
 
 In reality, many employers may end up doing the very thing a well-drafted religious discrimination bill should prevent: refuse to hire deeply religious people because of a fear they could cause serious damage to their business.
 
 The bill's notes provide plenty of other examples of different ways in which One Nation is seeking to tip the scales of our anti-discrimination law in favour of religious individuals and organisations above the legitimate rights of others.
 
 But this parable of the publisher alone should be sufficient for businesses to not just be alert, but seriously alarmed, about the unworkable nightmare that would be created if this legislation is allowed to pass.

60,Rising inequality can't be ignored,Fairfax,2021-01-31T18:13:43.701Z,"The Morrison government and the Reserve Bank must change their ways.
 
 An important issue that will dominate politics and challenge governments in coming years is inequality of both income and wealth.
 
 Trump's ascendancy to the US presidency was built on ""playing the inequality card"", skilfully crafted by adviser Steve Bannon as an appeal to those who ""had been left behind"" - initially the so-called ""angry white males"" who hadn't seen an improvement in their standard of living in a couple of decades.
 
 It was an easy get - to blame this on Washington elites, cheap Chinese and Mexican imports, weak borders and excessive immigration, promising to ""drain the Washington swamp"", create jobs, restore the glory of the rust belt states, build a wall and impose tariffs.
 
 Yet inequality continues to worsen in the US, compounded by COVID-19 and its economic and social consequences.
 
 The increase in inequality has been, to varying degrees, a global phenomenon. Speaking broadly, COVID-19 has had a more direct and severe impact on lower-income groups. While some COVID-19 budgetary assistance from governments did improve incomes for a time, the unemployment consequences risk entrenching both income and wealth inequality, with disparities between men and women, young and old, majorities and minorities.
 
 While much of the financial assistance extended by governments tends to favour particular industries, activities and income classes, the flood of liquidity from central banks drove a global explosion of asset prices, especially shares and property, to the conspicuous benefit of the wealthy.
 
 As a result, governments and central banks are, globally, under mounting pressure to recognise and be held accountable for the impacts of their policy initiatives on inequality.
 
 Concerns about inequality extend well beyond their economic and social significance. As Tony Ward argues in a Conversation piece, the less equal we become the less we trust expertise, science and authority.
 
 I have been advising the ACOSS/UNSW Poverty and Inequality Partnership. The latest report provides a baseline of data against which to assess the impact that both the national disasters of 2019-20 and the pandemic are having on inequality in Australia.
 
 Inequality was stark before these events. The highest 20 per cent of households, with average after-tax incomes of $4166 per week, had almost six times the income of the lowest 20 per cent. Wealth inequality was even worse - the highest 20 per cent, with an average wealth of $3.3 million, had 90 times the wealth of the lowest 20 per cent, with $36,000 on average.
 
 There is little doubt the Morrison government is not consciously aware or concerned about the likely impact on inequality of its responses to the worst economic and social circumstances since the Great Depression. Its motivation is to act quickly and decisively to offer temporary and reversible assistance.
 
 Nevertheless, it is encouraging that JobSeeker and JobKeeper actually reduce overall income inequality despite the dramatic rise in inequality of private incomes in the recession, although there are significant ""losers"" who are excluded from JobKeeper.
 
 However, as these payments are being wound back the effects of sustained high unemployment and lower income support are beginning to become evident, exacerbating income inequality. While some 75 per cent of jobs lost at the start of the COVID recession have been restored, about 85 per cent are part-time.
 
 Clearly, if income supports are not replaced by strong and sustained employment growth and an adequate, permanent increase in unemployment benefits, we are likely get higher levels of income inequality.
 
 People on JobSeeker are already being left seriously behind, with the government cutting the benefit to $50 a day at year's end, and threatening to cut it further back to the old Newstart level of $40 a day.
 
 The Reserve Bank has an important role to play as well. If it sustains the recent levels of monetary stimulus, such that financial and property markets continue to grow much stronger than our overall economic growth and wages growth, wealth inequality will also increase further.
 
 The government has also given expensive tax cuts to higher-income earners. The Australia Institute estimates more than 50 per cent of benefits go to the top 10 per cent of earners; 79-91 per cent to the top 20 per cent; and only 3-4 per cent to the bottom 50 per cent of income earners.
 
 Our government and the RBA should be explicitly required to take account of the impacts on inequality of their policy initiatives. The government should require an inequality impact statement to be attached to all key cabinet submissions, while the RBA should be required to address the issue in its regular statements on monetary policy.

61,Ryan's optimism and vision sorely needed today,Fairfax,2021-10-20T01:17:58.701Z,"Susan Ryan was a notable optimist in what I remember as optimistic times. Early in 1972, something new was in the air. It was an election year, and after 23 years of Liberal governments, change seemed possible.
 
 She had just separated from her diplomat husband, after a New York posting where she had witnessed the National Organisation for Women, new feminist advocates, engage in their coming presidential election. So she was part of the newly established Women's Electoral Lobby, or WEL, in Canberra. The organisation had spread rapidly from its Melbourne origins and the group in the ACT was very active. WEL knew how to lobby politicians and to create serious alternatives to some very macho agendas.
 
 Susan was an early leader. The convent-educated Catholic kid from Sydney's eastern suburbs had a passion for reform, for changes to laws that educated girls less, limited contraception despite the pill, criminalised abortions, and paid women less than men, even for the same jobs. As an ALP member, she was aware of the need to fix the lack of women's rights in work and education.
 
 Susan believed strongly that we could make changes. And indeed we did. Soon after the ALP's federal election win in 1972, there was progress in the equal pay case - a demand pushed strongly by WEL. More was to come.
 
 But this was not enough for Susan, although she had been a big part of our early lobbying success. She foresaw bigger successes if women became elected members of Parliament. She believed lobbyists could only go so far. As she explained in a speech in September 1992, she had gazed at a sea of male faces set to debate a private member's bill on abortion during the Whitlam years and realised women needed to be in the chamber.
 
 She got the numbers to be preselected, but in a true test of her never-say-die attitude she was elected in the year that the Whitlam government was dismissed.
 
 She was not discouraged. She worked on a Sex Discrimination Bill from opposition, so it was ready to go when she became a minister in 1983 with the Hawke government. It passed in 1984 and was followed by other important feminist bills. As education minister, she doubled the number of girls who finished high school, one of her other serious interests. She decided to leave Parliament in 1988, after 13 years, five as a very significant minister who had seriously improved women's lives and rights. But, again, she did not give up on social change, taking on as her next role the job of Human Rights Commissioner for Ageing and adding disability to her role when that was needed.
 
 The times today are nowhere near as optimistic as they were when I first met Susan. But her outlook and example have never been more important, especially if we are to fix the appalling mess the federal government has made in those areas that were her most recent passions: ageing and disability.
 
 Pessimism can be catching. I think too many on the left have caught it today. But unless you believe change is possible, there is no possibility for a better society. Some of it comes down to leadership - we need leaders who give us hope and have a vision for our future. And we all need to be persistent - and Susan was nothing if not persistent.
 
 She had a holistic view of what matters, and an undiminished commitment to justice and a fair go. Her feminism was always active and practical, her politics reasonable and effective.
 
 We will miss her optimism in dark times, her conviviality and her humour. In 2004, she received an Edna Ryan Award from WEL, which recognised her magnificent contributions. The commendation called her ""a symbol of Australia's commitment to equality for women"". This she remains.

62,Shore challenges won't earn entry to adult world,Fairfax,2021-11-29T01:48:28.406Z,"Is it bad that I am not surprised when I read the Triwizard Shorenament challenge book? Is it even worse that I understand it? When I read through the challenges, apparently written by the boys at Shore school, I see the intentions behind the words. Many of these challenges are - for the most part - the sorts of things I found funny too as an 18-year-old boy.
 
 They are clearly written with the false bravado and over-confidence many young boys possess: ""I can do that, just watch."" They include moaning in shops, jumping off wharfs, being a human bowling ball. I have done most of these sorts of things with my friends over the years.
 
 There are also those challenges which are clearly attempts to enter the adult world: ""win $50+ on the slaps"", ""Rail a cap"", ""Shoey a whole beer"". Again, I have done most (not all) of these things. But then there are those that reflect social structures of the world these boys are in. Spitting on a homeless person reeks of a class privilege where value and worth is attached to money. Women are dehumanised, reduced to a number out of 10 based on their attractiveness and used as jokes and points in a value system.
 
 There is no doubt an excess to the challenges written in the Shore document, abetted by financial advantage and protected by the social status of being a young white male. It's a list of things which are funny to people who have never sat on the phone with a girl they went to school with, who is pleading with them to stay on the line for a few hours so she isn't alone after being sexually assaulted at a party.
 
 Who has never sat and talked to a homeless person caught in a vicious cycle of eviction, denied applications and unemployment, who needs $24 for the night so they can stay at a shelter down the road.
 
 But this is not a completely bewildering prank sheet which speaks only of the entitlement of private schoolboys. Because there is a sentiment to it I understood as a year 6 kid at a public school too.
 
 I had my first ever interaction with the police at the age of 12, on my last day of primary school. A group of us caught a bus to a friend's house, singing a song full of swear words on the way. On the walk from the bus stop, we stopped at a half-built house and started throwing rocks at the windows, before crossing a line of tape to cause more destruction. About half an hour later, we were in the backyard of our friend's house painting skateboards when two police officers knocked at the door. A neighbour had been watching us at the construction site and called it in. All our parents were notified. In the car ride home, my bravado was gone. I started crying, unsure what the incident meant for my future.
 
 The end of school brings a sense of independence and freedom. The boundaries of your world expand and you want to push them. But when you don't understand responsibility, or consequence, danger lies ahead. Look deeper into this document and you will see the words of young people conjuring a rite of passage into a world they think they are ready for. While I swore on the back of the bus, taking those words to be a sign of my liberation, the Shore boys sought to have a slap, objectify women, drink piss and take drugs to thrust themselves into the adult world.
 
 These challenges are not a ticket to freedom, nor to adulthood. They are boyish fantasies of the world that awaits them. Reality is far more complicated. Perhaps if we are more honest with children, from a younger age, about issues we try to protect them from, like poverty and sexual assault and racism, they won't get to 18 and think they are jokes.
 
 And if parents are paying $200,000 for a school to educate their sons, you would hope that education came with a reality check, to ensure those boys stay grounded and know what that coveted adult world is really like. And what it takes to be a member of it.

63,STREWTH,News,2020-10-12T22:30:09.459Z,"Ring out for Julia!
 
 On Wednesday, it will be 10 years since Julia Gillard became Australia’s first female prime minister. There was a big celebration online on Sunday, but guess who didn’t know it?
 
 Julia’s neighbour, Beverley.
 
 How do we know? Because when the event went live at 2.30pm, all you could hear was: ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong.
 
 It was one of those moments when Gillard was all set up, ready in front of her Zoom camera for the big event, and Beverley was at the door, apparently keen to come in for a bit of a natter.
 
 Gillard could hardly get up and answer. She was about to go live to the world. And so, when her former parliamentary colleague and friend Tanya Plibersek opened the discussion by saying: “Hello, Julia, where are you and what are you doing?” she had to reply: “I’m in Adelaide, and you can probably hear the doorbell ringing … it’s Beverley from next door, and I’m sure she’ll get the message soon that nobody is coming to the door.” But no, she was not getting the message. Beverley — if indeed Beverley it was — kept ringing and ringing with greater urgency.
 
 “She’s a very persistent neighbour, isn’t she,” Plibersek said. “She is a very persistent neighbour,” Gillard agreed, laughing: “I am going to keep apologising for that doorbell … obviously she doesn’t realise I’m on this webinar.”
 
 Sophie’s choice photo You know who did, though? Special guest Wayne Swan, the former treasurer. He was there, as was the member for Newcastle Sharon Claydon, who said they were celebrating “10 years since having elected” Julia as the PM.
 
 Well, not quite. Gillard was appointed by the party. But, as Plibersek reminded viewers, she was the nation’s first female prime minister (also the first female deputy prime minister), and that’s a significant achievement. And she’s now on the world stage where she “hangs out” with people like Rihanna and Hillary Clinton.
 
 Gillard is cautious about getting involved in contemporary debates, but she was proud of many of the achievements of her government, among them plain packaging for cigarettes, and the NDIS, which reminded her of a special encounter with a little girl of 12 named Sophie Deane, who has Down syndrome. “We were having a cup of coffee and she loved to take photographs,” Gillard said. They formed a bond, and Sophie climbed onto her lap at one point, and then came a moment where she was bobbing down to Sophie’s eye-level, and Sophie took the joyful photo (seen here) that may be one of the best pictures ever taken of a prime minister. It has since been acquired by the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House.
 
 Hit and misogyny Viewers were given three polls, one of which was: which was your favourite moment of the Gillard prime ministership? The misogyny speech won it in a canter. Did you know it’s now been set to dance music, and the hit song gets all the millennials rocking?
 
 Viewers were also asked: what do we need to do to make sure we have another female PM in our lifetime? I know the answer to that one: one of the major parties will have to run a female candidate, and a majority of voters have to elect them. Or else it’s coup time. And we promised we wouldn’t do that anymore.
 
 Kevin puts the boot in Speaking of Kevin Rudd, who is this we spy having a bite to eat with his wife, Therese Rein, at the Pitchfork restaurant south of Noosa? Yes, it is he. And look at his shoes! Not everyone’s idea of style, but should somebody say: “Hey, Kevin, what do you think of the celebration of all things Julia — and also, what’s that on your feet?” he could respond: “Ugh!”",664

 The Swans have stood down Elijah Taylor after he was charged with assaulting a woman. Sydney officials, led by chief executive Tom Harley, acted swiftly after it emerged the young star allegedly assaulted his former girlfriend Lekahni Pearce.
 
 The Swans’ stance exposes the AFL’s deference to hide behind a so-called ‘Respect and Responsibility’ policy that has proven ineffective and inconsistent in these times.
 
 While Taylor has been stood down from all club commitments, star Collingwood footballer Jordan De Goey has played on like nothing has happened.
 
 De Goey, who has been charged with sexual assault of a woman, was best on ground on Monday in a match against the Gold Coast Suns.
 
 On Tuesday Gillon McLachlan released a statement that supported the Swans’ standdown of Taylor – and abhorring violence against women – but that firm move brazenly contradicts their stance on De Goey.
 
 The AFL have still said nothing about why they have let De Goey play. Is it because De Goey is a gun footballer for the all-powerful Eddie McGuire’s Collingwood? Have they let De Goey play on because he can literally turn a game on its head and win a final, maybe even a grand final?
 
 Why do they let him play?
 
 Rather than stating why, McLachlan has spent more time making it clear that the code would not be introducing a no-fault stand-down policy similar to the one in place in the NRL. Which brings us to the NRL’s ‘no-fault stand-down’ policy and the AFL’s spin on it.
 
 Behind the scenes the AFL has briefed journalists that under the NRL policy, De Goey would not be stood down.
 
 That is not the case.
 
 The Australian contacted the ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys to clarify the rule.
 
 “Our rule says you are automatically stood down if the charge carries a sentence of 11 years or more – however if it is an allegation of violence against women and children that is left to the discretion of the NRL CEO,” V’landys said.
 
 “Unless it is really exceptional circumstances, if it is an allegation involving a woman or child, it is most likely the NRL CEO will stand down the footballer.” Which is what the Swans have done. If Taylor is found guilty of aggravated assault, the maximum jail term is three years if dealt by a magistrate.
 
 Taylor’s troubles this year had already seen him sidelined after breaching the strict COVID-19 bubble conditions. In a statement Harley, whose management of the situation has been sensitive, swift and firm, spoke of the disappointment of having one of the club’s players in this position.
 
 “As a result of the serious nature of these charges, coupled with Elijah’s failure to abide by club directives on a number of occasions this year, we have made the decision to stand him down from all club commitments immediately,” Harley said. “We will review this position as the situation unfolds.
 
 “We believe this is the most appropriate course of action giving respect to all involved, and in light of the impending court proceedings.” McLachlan has said that the AFL’s Respect and Responsibility policy is “victim-centric”. That the wishes of the victim making the complaint is “what drives our actions”. The Sydney Swans have shown the AFL what victim-centric action really looks like.",604
65,Terrific coach - may women succeed him,Fairfax,2020-04-24T22:17:02.004Z,"Well done to Football Federation Australia for snagging one of the best women's coaches in the world, Tony Gustavsson, to guide the Matildas to a home World Cup in 2023.
 
 News of the Swede's appointment had barely filtered through when the question was asked: should we be disappointed they didn't appoint a woman to lead our favourite team?
 
 Women's football fans will be familiar with the disproportionate success of women coaches. Since Sydney 2000, female-coached teams have won all but one of the Women's World Cups, Olympic gold medals and Women's Euros - despite women coaches being outnumbered at every level.
 
 Of course, the dynamics of sporting success are far more complex than the gender of the coach. I've never known a coach to be hired or fired because of their gender. What we do know is that, while women coaches punch above their weight at the elite level, their journey has been more difficult.
 
 A recent study, Elite Women Coaches in Global Football, describes a sport where men have ""dominated coaching for so long that they have become synonymous with what it means to be a coach"". Women coaches, it found, ""exist in a system where they lack power, often do not feel supported or valued, and [which] leads them to experience many negative occupational, social and psychological outcomes"".
 
 Look around your local club: even the most junior coaching roles are somehow the preserve of dads, despite the ever-present ""soccer mums"" on the sidelines. My own experience was one of invisibility when well-meaning club officials came looking for volunteer parents. What was missing from my football CV that I couldn't hold a whistle in a pre-schoolers' kickabout?
 
 Women as coaches are indeed football's blind spot. Any woman who progresses beyond grassroots coaching will probably have attended a costly course where she is under-represented in the curriculum, only to find she is denied the opportunity to work in the more lucrative men's game.
 
 Typically, her failures will be extrapolated to her entire gender, while her successes are individualised or dismissed as lucky; she may be patronised or trolled by the few who suffer deep insecurities at the prospect of women in positions of sporting authority.
 
 She'll stare down this misogyny while being accused of playing the ""gender card"" to get or keep her job. That's the card that gets you a whopping discount off your wages. Even Jill Ellis, two-time World Cup winner with the US, was paid a fraction of the salary of her male counterpart, who didn't even qualify for the men's World Cup.
 
 Even in the US college system, where the federal civil rights reform Title IX outlawed gender discrimination in 1972 and thus supercharged women's sports programs, women coaches suffered. After Title IX, female athletes coached by women plummeted from more than 90 per cent to about 40 per cent today. As the money moved in, the women were moved out.
 
 Yet the elite women coaches study found ""resilient, highly competent exemplars from which much can be learnt"". Gustavsson has worked for two such women, Pia Sundhage and Jill Ellis, as they won on the biggest stages. He hails from Sweden, where Marika Domanski-Lyfors led the women's team to a World Cup final and became technical director of the federation.
 
 His background and track record gives us hope he will bring one of the most crucial qualities in a coach - to normalise a football environment in which women can thrive, as players and as staff.
 
 A key recommendation of the independent review of FFA's national teams last year, chaired by Diane Smith-Gander, identified gender balance among national team staff - ""including and especially coaching staff"". In sport, as in business, it lifts performance.
 
 If Gustavsson can facilitate a flourishing pipeline of women coaches to serve the game's future alongside men, he will give the Matildas a World Cup-winning chance not just as players in 2023, but also as coaches for many tournaments to come.

66,The Advertiser Celebrate AFLW,News,2021-04-14T02:29:21.499Z,"UNJUST critics of the AFL Women’s competition should think twice before firing off vitriol on social media.
 
 Footy fans have been voting with their feet since the AFLW’s inception in 2017, when the unexpectedly large crowds stunned organisers and generated significant excitement.
 
 One of the key reasons for this was the joy with which the players, so long denied the opportunity to compete at the elite level, participated in the game.
 
 Their passion has been infectious. Other women and girls have been inspired to take up the game, bringing in many new members at grassroots level.
 
 Given that girls had been excluded for so long, it is no surprise that AFLW teams do not boast the skills of their professional men’s counterparts – honed over generations of development and coaching.
 
 It is simply different. Players display enthusiasm that has, to some degree, been stripped from the AFL in the modern game. Thankfully, ill-informed and rude AFLW critics are a noisy minority. Most fans simply enjoy watching women having fun as they play footy.Responsibility for all editorial comment is taken by The Editor, Matt Deighton, 31 Waymouth St, Adelaide, SA ,5000",199
67,The Advertiser Never turn a blind eye to violence,News,2020-01-10T12:49:17.977Z,"THE shock expressed by Major Crime chief Superintendent Des Bray was palpable. “I’m at a complete loss to understand why anybody wouldn’t do something and go to the aid – or ensure that somebody went to the aid – of a woman who was screaming for help,” he said He was speaking in the wake of the murder of a 35-year-old woman, who was found by police inside her Morphett Vale unit the day before.
 
 Police revealed multiple witnesses heard a woman cry for help and a man threaten to kill her.
 
 But they did not call 000 to raise the alarm. They did not rush to her aid. She was left to die alone – a “horrible, violent death”, according to police.
 
 Her former partner has since been charged with her murder. His identity has been suppressed.
 
 Domestic violence remains a scourge on our community. It is still happening far too frequently. It is likely being exacerbated by the current crisis.
 
 But it is our role as a community to stamp it out; to show zero tolerance; to say enough is enough.
 
 We are not advocating people putting themselves in harm’s way – that is a very personal choice dependent on a variety of factors – but we must never, ever ignore calls for help. A simple phone call can save someone’s life.
 
 Our Watch, Australia’s leading organisation in the primary prevention of violence against women and children, agrees this is a shared, community responsibility. “We can be good bystanders and that means reporting suspicious circumstances, intervening when it is safe to do so and calling the police when someone is asking for help,” chief executive Patty Kinnersly said.
 
 Ms Kinnersly said 61 women died violently last year and 11 women had been murdered across Australia in 2020. That number must horrify us all. These are our mothers, our sisters, our friends our colleagues.
 
 As a community, it is our duty to protect and support these victims, not turn a blind eye.Responsibility for all editorial comment is taken by The Editor, Matt Deighton, 31 Waymouth St, Adelaide, SA ,5000",363
68,The good news on police and family violence,Fairfax,2021-07-23T22:14:18.947Z,"Domestic violence campaigners spent many years getting the police force to understand what it means to be a victim of violence. Decades of getting police to respond to call outs with empathy and with urgency.
 
 Mostly, that's worked. Police are getting better at dealing with domestic violence. That might be hard to believe after hearing Inspector Mark Thompson's comments on the Queensland murders of Hannah Clarke and her three children by her estranged husband. Thompson was removed from the case on Friday for suggesting this might be ""an instance of a husband being driven too far by issues that he's suffered, by certain circumstances, into committing acts of this form"".
 
 Thompson was wrong. Perhaps he misspoke due to his need to appear fair and balanced. He might even have just been so stressed. But those comments were outliers in a force which is, albeit slowly, catching up with a contemporary understanding of domestic violence.
 
 It's a massive relief to speak to Silke Meyer and Heather Douglas, two leading researchers in the area, who both say police attitudes to domestic violence are improving. Meyer, an associate professor at the Monash Gender and Family Violence Prevention Centre, examined police responses to domestic violence in her PhD 10 years ago and again last year. In that time, she's seen a huge shift.
 
 She makes a good point when she says its risky to share Thompson's remarks or to imagine those attitudes as endemic in the police force. Not for police, but for survivors of violence. If widely disseminated, Thompson's statement has the power to unravel all the progress made in recent years around help-seeking and building confidence in police treatment of those who experience domestic violence.
 
 There is no point in demeaning all police when the bulk of them are trying to do their best for victim and family safety, particularly if it ends up silencing victims again. We need more reports, not fewer.
 
 Only about one in five victims of domestic and family violence ever report their experience to police. In an Australian context, just over half of those using support services for domestic and family violence ever report. Meyer says among the victims she interviewed, just about half contacted police. The biggest predictor of reporting domestic violence is a victim believing her life is in danger.
 
 Heather Douglas, professor of law at the University of Queensland, also says there's been an improvement over 10 years in police attitudes, although she's not as confident as Meyer. Her advice to police: ""Focus on safety at the first call out.""
 
 Among her interviews with victims, she found women for whom the ongoing relationship with police saved their lives, they felt these officers were ready to help. But Douglas still has concerns. Police don't yet recognise the severity of non-physical abuse, such as financial or technological. ""And police pressure women to leave, instead of understanding all the complexities of leaving,"" she says.
 
 Meyer's research has been across Queensland and Victoria but she attends national conferences where she's seen a shift to a more proactive policing of domestic violence.
 
 ""Police forces across Australia have shown a real interest in doing better. I think that's very important to remember because otherwise I think Thompson's comments take the risk of silencing victim survivors,"" she says.
 
 Mark Jones, assistant commissioner and NSW Police corporate spokesperson for domestic and family violence, won't promise me Thompson's remarks would never be heard in NSW but he thinks it's unlikely. There's been a lot of training, programs, modules to help NSW police improve.
 
 Next, the police will have to work on recruiting more women (only about 27 per cent in NSW are women). They do better at dealing with victim survivors.

69,The planet's greatest human rights violation is men harming women,Fairfax,2020-01-27T03:33:48.496Z,"It is no small task trying to unpack the history of any kind of hatred, especially if that hatred is misogyny. For the past 10 days - ever since the horrifying murders in Brisbane of Hannah Clarke and her three children, Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4 and Trey, 3 - I've been trying to come to grips all over again with what it is that men do to women with their fists, their guns, their knives, their petrol containers, their unspeakable acts of violence. And why?
 
 All the women killed on their way home, or in their homes, or just anywhere they happen to be - stabbed in the chest, shot in the head, viciously bashed, set on fire, found in a park, dumped behind a hedge, slumped against a wall, stuffed into the back of a ute - and all this documented with heartbreaking regularity by researchers for an organisation that should never exist: Destroy the Joint's Counting Dead Women Australia.
 
 During these past 10 days, I've gone through my own hopelessly incomplete rollcall of dead women: Jill Meagher, Eurydice Dixon, Amanda Harris, Larissa Beilby, Qi Yu, Aya Maasarwe, Hannah Clarke ... and, yes, I've thought, too, about the Serbian ""rape camps"" during the Balkan wars, and the millions of girls sex-trafficked every year. I've thought about bride burnings, honour killings, forced marriages, female feticide, genital mutilation, date rape, gang rape, women left bloodied, broken and homeless in their own bodies.
 
 I've spent the past 2½ years trying to investigate the historical causes of these universal crimes against women, not - as Bettina Arndt suggested when my recent book was published - because I was trying to ""virtue signal"" to women. Rather, because in the wake of the #MeToo movement, I've wanted to understand better what millions of women were testifying to: stories of being slapped, stalked, groped, assaulted, raped, degraded, silenced and disbelieved.
 
 I wanted to understand - as a man, a father, a son, a brother and friend to many wonderful women - what causes this murderous male contempt to rage across the world. And I wanted men - even those who profess to be good men - to join me in this investigation, for the simple reason that it is men who are perpetrating most of the violence.
 
 This is the greatest human rights violation on the planet, with the World Health Organisation reporting that 1 billion women will be raped or beaten in their lifetime. Here in Australia, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology, 1.2 million adult women have experienced an incident of sexual violence since they were 15 while, according to Our Watch, one woman a week on average is killed by her current or former partner.
 
 Add to this the hundreds of thousands of women requiring medical attention or hospitalisation, who fear daily for their lives, who are controlled menacingly by partners and former partners, whose children are weaponised by their fathers, and this is the national emergency we can no longer ignore, if ever we could.
 
 In his masterful book Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice, the late Irish journalist Jack Holland wrote that ""on the depressing list of hatreds that human beings feel for each other, none other than misogyny involves the profound need and desire that most men have for women"".
 
 ""Hatred co-exists with desire in a peculiar way,"" he wrote. ""This is what makes misogyny so complex [because] it involves a man's conflict with himself.""
 
 Moved by the murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children on February 19, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said family violence would be on the agenda for the upcoming meeting of state and territory leaders, while opposition leader Anthony Albanese rewened his calls for a national domestic violence summit.
 
 I would like to offer another suggestion - a national education program that starts with boys, perhaps as young as two or three, that teaches them skills such as empathy and self-regulation, and unpacks the crippling stereotypes that socialise boys to feel superior to girls so they grow into men who objectify women and see them as their property.
 
 A program built around a new model of manhood that embraces the work of men such as Tom Harkin at Tomorrow Man, Hunter Johnson at The Man Cave and Arne Rubinstein at the Rites of Passage Institute, as well as the Jesuit Social Services 2018 ""Man Box"" study, all of which address how boys and young men might be taught to treat girls with the same respect and kindness that they would wish for themselves. A program, that explains to them there is nothing ""manly"" about dominating others, nothing impressive about pretending not to be in pain, and nothing meaningful in this world without the capacity to be vulnerable.
 
 You start out in life sensitive and full of wonder, open to the world and all its possibilities, but, then, after a certain age, these qualities are shamed, beaten, bullied out of you by the culture and, often, by the men who run our nations, corporations, legal firms, sporting clubs, schools, advertising agencies, film industries and media outlets. Is it any wonder that men are never taught to deal with their emotions in a healthy way? Perhaps this is at the heart of men's rage, whether expressed through murder, rape, domestic violence, suicide, alcoholism, reckless driving or simply sullen withdrawal from the world. If men attack - or are in conflict with - women in the outer world, it is because they are at war with their inner world. Don't be a sissy. Suck it up. Stop your crying now. All the stock definitions of masculinity that prevent boys from dealing with - as Steve Biddulph puts it - ""the storms and subtleties"" inside our hearts.
 
 Centuries of patriarchy have raised boys to reject and scorn the interior world where our deepest feelings are lodged. Why should it surprise us, therefore, that boys might grow into men who view women as less than
 
 fully human?
 
 Women are right to feel exhausted and terrified. The body count is rising and there will probably be another woman killed next week, and the week after. What are we men going to do about it?

70,THERE’S A CATCH WITH THE EQUAL PAY PITCH,News,2020-02-15T18:03:46.818Z,"It’s time for us to call stumps on International Women’s Day I don’t watch sport much these days. My team, the Carlton Football Club, has been in a decades-long form slump. It’s no fun seeing your team being flogged, week after week.
 
 But I was able to locate the ­television channel on which the women’s T20 World Club final was being broadcast and spent some enjoyable hours watching the Australians’ emphatic win.
 
 Notwithstanding India’s excellent form during the competition, the Australian cricketers were outstanding on Sunday night. Their fielding was exceptional.
 
 The fact the match was held on International Women’s Day was neither here nor there. It was a great spectacle, with outstanding athletes participating to win the prize of a world championship for the team.
 
 As far as International Women’s Day is concerned, my feeling is another year, another day. It has become a yawn.
 
 Pre-prepared materials are wheeled out, showing how some women have been able to overcome the odds to achieve great things. But ominous warnings are sounded that indicate significant barriers still exist and action must be taken.
 
 Politicians get in on the act to appear virtuous. Our own Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Karen Andrews, launched two initiatives to get more women into STEM subjects: “Equipping our girls with the skills they need is not only the right thing to do – it’s essential to the future prosperity of our nation.” She claimed that 75 per cent of jobs in growing industries would require STEM skills. Professor Andrew Norton has effectively demolished this assertion, demonstrating there is no basis in fact for it. There is also a definitional problem to the analysis, with some ­occupations such as librarian, ­accountant, public policy analyst and economist deemed to require STEM skills.
 
 Norton also points out that graduate outcomes in Australia indicate there is no shortage of STEM graduates. Indeed, some STEM graduates do very poorly — in biological sciences, for instance — in terms of employment outcomes and being able to use their skills and knowledge And the idea of discounting the score for women to enter certain STEM-related higher education courses is just insulting. It may also set up a number of them to fail — a strange way to “help”.
 
 Perhaps the most totemic issue of International Women’s Day — and an ongoing one for our Sex Discrimination Commissioner and the superfluous Workplace Gender Equality Agency — is the so-called gender pay gap.
 
 Gross figures of the difference between average male and female earnings are quoted as if they are meaningful. The only adjustment made is for full-time and part-time work. They are riddled with compositional effects and they disguise the fact there is only a pay gap for higher-income earners.
 
 National figures will be quoted telling us the gender pay gap is now 13.9 per cent, down from 14.1 per cent in the previous year. But these types of announcement leave economists unimpressed.
 
 There have been some exciting developments in terms of understanding the gender pay gap, to the point that most economists now have a very clear understanding of what is at play.
 
 The key issue is that long and ­irregular hours are disproportionately rewarded in the labour market and that women, on average, are less inclined to take these types of jobs relative to men. There are also some jobs that heavily punish any career interruptions in pay terms. These ideas are particularly associated with Professor Claudia Goldin of Harvard.
 
 Goldin traced the employment and pay outcomes of MBA graduates in the US. Interestingly, she found that female MBA graduates whose partners earned less than them do relatively well — the hourly rate of pay for those graduates is the same for males. They have an incentive to earn more. But because these women opt to work fewer hours, their lifetime earnings are still lower.
 
 There was also an important ­recent study from Sweden. This country is home to the promotion of gender equality, with the state providing very generous and lengthy parental leave. But after Swedish women have children, they tend to choose jobs that enable them to work regular hours and that involve little travel so they can drive a balance between work and family.
 
 We see this in the proportion of women in senior private-sector roles in Sweden — just 36 per cent of these positions are occupied by women. (The proportion is even lower in Denmark, at 28 per cent; while in Finland and Norway it’s 32 per cent.) The effect of these decisions — often made jointly with their partners — is to reduce the average wage of women relative to men, notwithstanding that, at least initially, women are as well educated or even better educated than men. (For some time, more women than men have been attending higher education in Australia.) Another important study uses French data and deals with less-skilled workers. When workers in France sign on for unemployment benefits, they are required to ­provide information on the commuting distances and times that would be acceptable in terms of taking up a job.
 
 This shows that women are only prepared to take jobs that involve relatively short commuting distances and times. This limits their choice of employment and reduces women’s pay. By contrast, some men are prepared to travel long distances and spend a lot of time to take up difficult-to-fill jobs — and are rewarded for doing so.
 
 Feminists might argue that women are wrong to place a premium on seeking a balance between work and family life or that there is something wrong with a labour market in which long and irregular hours are disproportionately rewarded.
 
 But it is for women to choose what suits their family situations. And most people will not put in long and irregular hours, often involving onerous travel, unless they are well paid to do so.So congratulations to the women’s cricket team on the magnificent win. But it may just be time to retire International Women’s Day with its dreary hashtags. This year was #EachforEqual, which might meet the alliteration test but makes no sense.",1047
71,This crash has hurt women most,Others,2021-05-13T09:44:03.911Z,"Whether it's extra domestic work, caring for children or unemployment, the economic burden of COVID-19 is falling disproportionately on women. It's a hard truth - but it's also the key to finding our way out of recession.
 
 I hope that before I die Coalition governments recognise the importance of women to society. Actually, scrap that - it's too ambitious.
 
 I hope that Coalition governments recognise the importance of women to the economy.
 
 My cynicism stems from the widely touted review of how the party treated women, built on the Banks of the departing Julia, who now runs her own consultancy. That was nearly two years ago, and not a sign of the review any time soon. Apparently some high flyer drafted something and it ended up in the bin.
 
 I know, I know. Coronavirus! And dealing with the impacts of COVID-19 is really important. That is, the impacts on everyone at every level of society.
 
 So, if you can't keep your own party in good shape, does it bode well for the country, for the economy or for society? Short answer: unlikely.
 
 Women are in trouble. Multiple disasters in Australia have reinforced gender stereotypes. Women are the ones bearing the load of teaching at home, juggling like crazy trying to keep the domestic and the work in balance. I see women in the park with their kids, late in the afternoon, trying to entertain and parent while talking emphatically to their bosses or their colleagues.
 
 It's fine for Scott Morrison to say he wants the economy to snap back - but some of us have lost our ability to be resilient in the face of endless pressures: the bushfires, pollution, air quality, hailstorms and now COVID-19. I'm terrified the plague of frogs is about to descend.
 
 A bunch of brilliant women have come together to form the Snap Forward Feminist Policy Network, convened by the 50/50 by 2030 Foundation at the University of Canberra. They are making a submission to the Parliamentary COVID-19 inquiry. Snap Forward because we need to be ""moving forward"", a notion I thought this government might embrace.
 
 The submission's purpose is to ensure a COVID-19 response which considers women, a response which contributes to gender equality. I wouldn't consider this to be a high priority for the Morrison government. I don't see evidence of a group of people which takes into account the needs of the marginalised. Please note that JobKeeper and JobSeeker only got real when ""people like us"" were impacted.
 
 But there is clear evidence that all women are impacted. Melbourne University's Lyn Craig has already got a first cut of research she's conducted on the impact of COVID-19 on households. There's an extra six hours of work caring for kids. Women are doing twice as much as their male partners. Think that's no biggie? That has a direct impact on the time women can spend on their paid work, which may indeed impact on whether they keep their paid work.
 
 A report released by ACOSS this week is concerning - and remember, it was undertaken before the impact of the coronavirus. ACOSS acting chief executive Jacqueline Phillips says poverty hits hardest where women are the main income earners. Those households are twice as likely to live in poverty as those where men are the main income earners with the gap even higher in households with children.
 
 But hasn't that all been fixed by the COVID-related extra payments for JobSeeker in particular? Not exactly, considering all those benefits run out in five minutes. Phillips points out that more than a third of single mothers and their kids are living in poverty.
 
 You don't need any imagination to know what will happen after the increases disappear (thank Gaia for Philip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank, who keeps explaining that the government needs to do more to support the economy).
 
 So, what to do next for women, who are over half the population?
 
 The women of Snap Forward have some ideas. We know we have a chronic shortage of social and public housing. Let's get JobMaker to start right there. Direct the stimulus to invest directly in improving the lives of those in poverty.
 
 As ACOSS's Phillips says, women are the first affected and the worst affected - and we know that in Australia, unemployment has hit women harder than men. The April unemployment figures saw female employment drop by 8.1 per cent, while male employment fell by 6.2 per cent. And God knows what fresh horrors will emerge when JobKeeper ends.
 
 Snap Forward urges the government to support the many faces of women's economic contributions to this country. Support and encourage women-led business (and maybe give a ready-set-go fund to women-led startups, or as they used to be known, small businesses).
 
 Protect the precariette, the women who work as casuals and keep our lives together, the retail and hospitality workers, the nurses called in at the last minute. The government wants to do a wholesale review of industrial laws? Make sure they consult those who are done over time and time again: the women who keep the country ticking. Focus on protections for feminised workforces (hello childcare!). And while you're at it, value the contribution of women's unpaid labour to the Australian economy.
 
 The Snap Forward team recommends mandating a gender-responsive budgeting to be applied across the COVID-19 response and recovery, supported by a Treasury-funded Gender Equality Budget Group and increased investment in public service capacity and accountability for gender analysis.
 
 This is precisely what Canberra's legendary Marie Coleman of the National Foundation for Australian Women has been demanding for years. I reckon once that happens, the matrix of women's needs will be apparent - not just in employment support but across childcare, family violence services, health and education. The list is long and mostly it's stuff we needed before COVID-19. Now women need it more.
 
 Can we trust the Morrison government to deliver for women? I've been surprised before, and I can only hope I will be surprised again. I'm not holding my breath.

It's tried to look like the good guy by wielding tax cuts and flying in a few desperate citizens from outposts varied, but that's because it needs to be pragmatic. The rest of the time it is trying to impose its ideological position on the rest of us. We are the hapless water buffalo and the Prime Minister is the abattoir's leading hand.
 
 Let me present the first public victims.
 
 I've known Osmond Chiu since he was a teenager. Fine, upstanding Australian. Completely committed to improving the lives of working Australians. Married to the excellent Luisa.
 
 I met Wesa Chau when she gave me excellent feedback on a conference paper. She came to Australia as a seven-year-old, and I'd argue she has a broader accent than I do (what with the woggy influence of my darling dearly departed parents). Also, she is now running as candidate for deputy mayor of Melbourne. Greater love hath no woman for her country than volunteering for local council.
 
 There's also Yun Jiang, who was a public servant but left last year because of a combination of casual racism and constraints around freedom of speech. Now she edits the China Story blog for the Australian National University.
 
 What happened to these three Australians at the hands of Senator Eric Abetz was unforgivable. They were witnesses at the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee's inquiry into issues facing diaspora communities in Australia, when Abetz asked each of them to tell him whether they were ""willing to unconditionally condemn the Chinese Communist Party dictatorship"". As Wanning Sun, who was going to give evidence at the inquiry but changed her mind, wrote: ""All three were attending the hearing voluntarily at the invitation of the committee, to clarify and elaborate on their written submissions.""
 
 In the ACT alone, over 4 per cent of census respondents cite Chinese heritage. Across the whole of Australia it's just a little under that number, at 3.9 per cent. Are we assuming each of them carries a torch for dictatorships of various kinds? How come no one ever asked Eric Abetz about his great uncle, Otto Abetz, a Nazi (who did some good things apparently, such as protecting Jewish art)? Shame about the actual makers of that art. Should we ask Eric Abetz to disavow Nazism and its attendant racism?
 
 Abetz's inquiries are a purposeful disruption of how we normally get along in this country, spreading doubt and division.
 
 Of course, in his government, he is not alone. The constant misinformation spread by the government about its funding of the ABC is an excellent example. Funding gets cut. The government denies it has been cut. Yet those non-cuts lead to fears the ABC's reach into regional Australia will be slashed, massive numbers of staff being made redundant and an inability to plan for the future. That's one way of controlling the message. Another is to get glorious political correspondent Laura Tingle to delete her tweet criticising the government for its funding cuts: ""We grieve the loss of so many of our fine colleagues to government ideological bastardry."" That sad story featured in Senate estimates on Wednesday night when the ABC's managing director said Tingle recognised the tweet was an error. An error of judgment, maybe, but not, I'd argue, of fact.
 
 And let's not even discuss the devastation wrought upon the university sector, the arts sector, childcare and caring work of all kinds. This is a government which has narrow priorities and uses its ideological warriors to do its work.
 
 When I was a young woman at university, one of the texts we borrowed from the library was The News From South-East Asia. It was a sociological study of the making of news by Rod Tiffen. He went on to become a professor of politics at the University of Sydney, and has studied Australian political practice over 40 years.
 
 He has never seen it so divided nor so divisive.

 ""I haven't seen this combination ... the combustible nature of public controversies about China, the cutting of funds to the ABC, the hostility to universities and to climate change science. It is strange it is happening in the shadow of the pandemic,"" he says.
 
 And he believes there won't be too much pushback from voters, except those whose kids are about to start university. He can't quite believe, even from retirement, the attacks on universities, much more carefully constructed than limp attacks on student unions by Christopher Pyne and failed former prime minister Tony Abbott.
 
 ""There was a degree of unity early in the pandemic - March, April - and that moment of bipartisan co-operation has passed with a vengeance. The university stuff is exactly what they don't need at the moment.""
 
 And what about the bizarre anti-China behaviour of people like George Christensen? I mean, how useful is it to compare our biggest trading partner with Nazi Germany? Of course, of course, we have to fight human rights abuses in China. But we shouldn't be abusing our own citizens here, or devaluing what equality really means.
 
 The big problem is this: this government is destroying the regular Australia. The one which might do a bit of staring at the new kid at school, but will end up asking her for a sleepover. The one which loves and appreciates the ABC, the extraordinary emergency broadcaster with a national reach and understanding of our nation. The one which seeks a decent education for its children and hopes its hapless second daughter will get into uni (yeah, Mum, I ended up with three degrees). The one which only a few years ago was getting the hang of the old equality thing.
 
 Tiffen says the government's ideological vendetta, the way it conducts these public controversies, demeans debate. And that's a bloke who has been studying politics for 40 years.

73,Tiny wage is not a good look,News,2020-03-09T07:23:28.987Z,"WE’RE 11 days out from Christmas and the silly season shopping rush is ramping up in true 2020 style.
 
 Deloitte’s annual Christmas survey suggests some retailers are anticipating a bumper season — welcome news for business and workers after a tough year of shutdowns, job losses and reduced hours.
 
 As we head out — or online — to buy gifts for loved ones, or something special to wear over the holidays, we should keep in mind the devastating impact the global pandemic has had on the workers, mainly women, who make our clothes.
 
 Oxfam has released groundbreaking research revealing the poor business practices of big Australian fashion brands that are part of a system of exploitation keeping the women who make our clothes trapped in poverty, no matter how hard they work.
 
 Shopping for a Bargain, conducted with Monash University, is the first detailed investigation into the way leading fashion retailers operating in Australia do business with their suppliers.
 
 It shows how conventional purchasing practices such as aggressive price negotiation, inaccurate forecasting of orders and short lead times keep wages low and force factories to cut corners, placing workers at risk.
 
 COVID-19 resulted in some of the most extreme examples. Big brands around the world cancelled orders, delayed payments and sought discounts for clothes already made. This left factory owners in garment-producing countries like Bangladesh out of pocket. Almost overnight, they stood down hundreds of thousands of workers without notice — and often without pay.
 
 Without any savings, often saddled with debt accrued to subsidise wages — and without support like JobKeeper/JobSeeker to rely on — many of the women who make our clothes were left to face the pandemic in extreme poverty.
 
 So as the businesses that have fought so hard to survive find new COVID-normal ways of operating, we’re redoubling our efforts to ask big fashion brands to end poverty wages in their supply chains, including by improving the way they do business with suppliers.
 
 Ensuring the recovery of the retail sector and paying the people who make our clothes a living wage can happen at the same time.
 
 We call on big retailers to join the 12 brands in Australia that have already committed to paying a living wage. All big brands must improve the way they do business to make that promise a reality. LYN MORGAIN IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF OXFAM AUSTRALIA",407

75,VIOLENCE MESSAGE IS ALL TALK,News,2020-05-09T04:00:12.246Z,"VICTORIA’S justice system is one in name only. A system that prioritises the interests of violent offenders over victims and the wider community is one that has sadly lost its way.
 
 How can a civilised country, where women are afforded equal rights and protections, allow a violent thug to walk free from court despite a sickening attack against a vulnerable woman, an attack caught on CCTV?
 
 How can any victim of violence feel they will be treated fairly by the court when a vicious attack, captured in its entirety on video, is not enough to send the assailant to prison?
 
 Essendon District footballer Jackson Williams grabbed his victim — a nurse walking to work on October 28, 2018 — from behind and dragged her into a CBD laneway.
 
 The 21-year-old put the terrified woman into a headlock and dragged her further into Brights Place before pinning her on the ground and covering her mouth to stifle her screams.
 
 The 37-second ordeal only came to a stop thanks to the brave intervention of Adrian Woodgate, an off-duty police officer from New Zealand, who ran to the nurse’s assistance.
 
 The victim, who has since left Victoria, has not been able to return to her job as a nurse. She must bear not only the physical marks of the attack but also deep psychological scars.
 
 To be set upon in such a brutal manner by a powerfully built man determined to harm you would be terrifying. Also terrifying must be the question of what would have happened if the attack was not interrupted.
 
 One fears the victim is haunted by that question and indeed any woman who has seen the footage is made keenly aware of how vulnerable we all are if attacked by a physically strong man intent on violence.
 
 There was simply nothing she could have done to protect herself, she was at the mercy of a monster who threw her to the ground and pinned her legs with his own.
 
 And yet, incredibly, the judge hearing the case determined this was not a sexually motivated assault and found Williams not guilty of intent to commit a sexual offence, which carries a 15-year maximum term.
 
 Instead, the former Westmeadows Tigers player was found guilty of common law assault and on Wednesday given a community corrections order, 200 hours of unpaid work, plus time already served, being 42 days. He walked free from court never explaining his motivation for the attack.
 
 If not to sexually assault the victim, why did he grab her by the neck, throw her to the ground and use his weight to hold her down?
 
 One would have thought the crystal clear video footage would have removed the element of doubt in the case; no “he said, she said” conundrum for the court to unravel. It was a simple case of an innocent woman walking down a street minding her own business being grabbed by the neck and assaulted by a dangerous criminal.
 
 Williams’ trial was by judge-only, and like a number of other judge-only cases heard in Victoria due to COVID-19, the accused has been found not guilty of the most serious charge.
 
 County Court judge Amanda Fox, appointed by Labor in mid-2018, said Williams had been “unfairly subjected” to “a form of extra-curial punishment” including online threats and racial abuse. She also noted Williams, the son of a Sydney barrister, had been kicked out of his football club.
 
 Earlier the court heard Williams had a low IQ, experienced “emotional dysfunction” and struggled with cultural issues after learning of his Aboriginal heritage at the age of 12.
 
 No sensible person would support any level of vigilante behaviour but the risk of people taking matters into their own hands only increases when they have little faith in the judicial process.
 
 In this case, it feels as if not only was the victim effectively abandoned but we are now asked to feel sympathy for her attacker because he says he’s sorry and has been the target of threats and vitriol.
 
 Sentencing that’s wildly out of touch with community expectations shakes the public’s faith in the justice system.
 
 In the week that Victoria reels from the shocking murder of a much-loved daughter and sister, Celeste Manno, allegedly killed by an obsessed stalker, we are reminded again the system needs to better protect at-risk women.
 
 We either take violence against women seriously when it occurs or we are just paying lip service to the cause.
 
 Spending tens of millions on “awareness” campaigns is not as effective as ensuring women have faith in the justice system.

76,We must get women back to work,Fairfax,2020-10-05T06:55:29.326Z,"This crisis has hurt women but flexibility and childcare will help them, and the economy, recover.
 
 As Australians emerge from the depths of the lockdown, there is a sense that more things have changed than the colour of the leaves. But which changes will be permanent and which will be swept away as we slowly return to ""normal""?
 
 For those of us lucky enough to still be in work, the biggest shift has been from working in an office block to working at our kitchen tables. Spending more time at home has changed some household dynamics but reinforced many others. Siblings seem to be fighting less but it is once again women doing most of the caring. The Prime Minister declared in the great school debate that he didn't want Australians choosing between working and caring for their children but the latest unemployment figures reveal that women have done just that.
 
 With participation in the job market dropping to levels last seen in 2004, women were 50 per cent more likely to have stopped looking for work than men.
 
 The economic impact on women from the pandemic is mounting as one of the biggest issues for the recovery. Professions dominated by women - including retail, hospitality and education - have been hardest hit by the lockdown. Added to this are the additional caring responsibilities the lockdown has generated and women are working more but being paid less.
 
 Last month's Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show men reduced their hours of paid work 7.5 per cent, and women 11.5 per cent. This drop in employment will affect women's short-term financial security but also their long-term economic engagement.
 
 If the pandemic leads to a permanent widening of the gap between male and female employment, it will undermine the economic recovery. With the drop in international migration removing the population from the three P's of economic growth, we will have to rely on the other two: participation and productivity. Women are the key to this equation.
 
 A 2018 McKinsey report estimates closing the gap on female participation in the workforce to the best in our region - the Philippines - would increase the size of the Australian economy by 12 per cent in 2025. There is no other economic reform with this type of pay-off. The benefits do not just come from extra workers. Gender diversity increases the productivity of the entire workforce.
 
 In the gloom of the economic ruin of COVID-19 there is hope that in rebuilding our economy we can better utilise the skills and experience of women. Our current model of work developed at a time when only one person, a man, in the household was in paid employment. That has changed: 70 per cent of families now have two earners. But the way we work and the way we care has remained rigid, putting families, and women in particular, under pressure.
 
 New ways of working allow women and men to better navigate work and family responsibilities. Not only have studies found workplaces with greater flexibility improve productivity, but flexibility is also a key driver in women returning to the workforce after having children.
 
 Greater flexibility has been a gradual process in Australian workplaces. Those working from home often miss out on opportunities at work and promotions. If we can retain the normalisation of new flexible work practices for men and women, we will remove these penalties and make a giant step towards gender equity. There is a risk that all flexible working does is help women do everything. There is also a need for a renegotiation at home about who does the care work. In my favourite statistic from COVID-19, nearly half of men in New York claimed they did most of the home-schooling - 3 per cent of women agreed.
 
 The other revolution brought about from COVID-19 has been free childcare. Once seen as utopian dream of a socialist Australia, it was introduced to keep the capitalist market afloat.
 
 Childcare costs are the biggest financial barrier for women with young children increasing their participation in the workforce. Women can end up keeping just 10 cents in every extra dollar earned from a day's work. Grattan Institute modelling recently showed increasing childcare subsidies for low-income earners could help grow the economy by $11 billion a year.
 
 As the government gets ready to end its free childcare policy in June, it would be well advised to consider the negative impact on economic growth. When reports say that even the bean counters at Treasury have called for some form of free childcare to be retained, you know that the economic case for cheaper childcare and increased female participation in the workforce is strong.
 
 Before COVID-19, Australian women were looking at 251-year wait before they were to reach economic parity with men. If this wasn't long enough, the initial impacts of the pandemic on female employment threaten to put the advancement of women towards equity back another generation.
 
 As we emerge from hibernation, if we can resist the urge to ditch changes brought by COVID-19 that have heralded greater flexibility and reduced costs of working for women, we can bring the possibility of equity into a reality not for distant descendants, but our daughters. That is a change we would all like to see.

77,We need to stop being bystanders,Fairfax,2021-07-13T19:09:00.174Z,"As individuals, we find it hard to stand up to sexism and racism but there is a way to make it easier.
 
 I've been thinking about my four murdered grandparents much more over the past few weeks. Who could have stopped that from happening? Who allowed it to happen? The murder of the Jews in Europe was state sanctioned but ordinary people endorsed it. They signed up to support the state.
 
 Academic Aileen Moreton-Robinson, whose life's work is on race, whiteness and racism, sees that here in Australia too. White Australians support the status quo because anything else would be too uncomfortable. It would mean giving up power. Can we change that?
 
 So much of late - from AFL player Heritier Lumumba's allegations of racist treatment at Collingwood, the Black Lives Matter protests and even the Dyson Heydon sexual harassment allegations - make it clear change cannot wait.
 
 When we ignore racism, sexism and violence against others, it makes us complicit. It's comforting to think we are different but if you don't challenge the practices of sexism and racism in your workplace, then you benefit from the privileges they confer. If we are part of the dominant group, we have a vested interest when there are fewer competitors in the pool.
 
 But there's also another unpleasant characteristic in all of us: we are hopeless bystanders. New research from the Australian Human Rights Commission shows the percentage of bystanders willing to act on sexual harassment they have observed in their workplace has fallen from one in two, to one in three in just six years. Kate Jenkins, Sex Discrimination Commissioner, says one reason for this unwillingness was bystanders' fearfulness for their careers. In particular, men reported being confused about what sexual harassment was and what they should do if they witnessed it.
 
 This backs up the work of criminologist Bianca Fileborn, who says men are less likely to intervene partly because of what she describes as social embarrassment. It's unsurprising to her that the Dyson Heydon story only emerged when a woman, Susan Keifel, became Chief Justice of the High Court.
 
 Kevin Dunn, pro vice-chancellor, research, at Western Sydney University, and a lifelong researcher into racism, says plenty of folks say they would stand up for someone experiencing racism but only about 30 per cent actually do it.
 
 As individuals, we find it hard to stand up and confront perpetrators. Instead of recognising the answer is to collectively challenge institutional power, we try to be individual heroes. But there are actions we can take beyond tweeting, Facebooking and Instagramming, which are useful for mobilising but less useful for organising to make change.
 
 Moreton-Robinson has some ideas. Last month, the RMIT professor was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. That's a huge deal - she's the first Indigenous scholar to be elected outside the United States. She's loath to answer questions about how white people can help. Figuring that out should be the work of white people. But she does have some robust advice - we must all think about how we can share power. ""You can't have race privilege without race disadvantage and you can't have structural advantage without other people being oppressed on the basis of race, one cannot work without the other.
 
 ""Race privilege exists as an effect of white male dominance,"" she says. Those who wish to effect change must challenge the institutional power that provides them with the capacity to do so. Maybe other judges felt Heydon was doing the wrong thing but didn't challenge it because of their investment in power.
 
 As the University of Melbourne's Ghassan Hage suggests, if some of our weakness in the face of oppression is about precarious employment, the best way to negotiate that is to act collectively.
 
 In our institutions, let's not just have those happy celebrations of diversity or multiculturalism. Build a different kind of culture that is hungry to examine flaws and weaknesses. The chief executive of law firm Maddocks, Michelle Dixon, has tried to do just that. She says dismantling the hierarchy is hard - and listening to criticism can be confronting for leaders. It's a little easier to confront power if there are a few of you doing it at once. Don't just isolate the women of colour to do it on their own. Be a supporter - but let others do the leading. (I find this so hard. I almost always think I know best.)
 
 Empathy is good. Action is better. Act on Beyonce's advice. On Sunday (US time), she accepted an award for humanitarian work at the BET (Black Entertainment Television) Awards and encouraged others: ""To take action, continue to change and dismantle a racist and unequal system ... we have to continue to do this together, to fight for each other and lift each other up.""
 
 I know there will be people who read this and think that comparing the Jews' experience of Nazism to what Aboriginal and Torres Islanders experience is hyperbolic. But being excluded from a job, a profession, an industry, a society, being treated poorly at work and on the streets, that's not just how genocide begins. That's how it ends unless we decide to make change.

78,Weinstein verdict is ultimately an unsatisfactory victory,Fairfax,2021-11-27T22:38:35.695Z,"The failure to convict the disgraced film mogul on the 'predatory' nature of his conduct highlights the limits of the justice system, writes Kristine Ziwica.
 
 Annabella Sciorra, Mimi Haleyi, Jessica Mann, Dawn Dunning and the nearly 90 women who have come forward with allegations of sexual assault and rape against the now infamous film producer Harvey Weinstein, these are the women I'm thinking about today.
 
 And the millions of women who bore their soul as part of #MeToo, hoping Weinstein's trial would deliver accountability - not just to an abhorrent individual, but to an abhorrent system that enabled men like Weinstein to go unchecked for so long.
 
 The verdict in New York delivered a partial, but ultimately unsatisfactory, victory. Weinstein was found guilty by a jury of seven men and five women of two felony sex crimes but acquitted on the most serious charge of ""predatory sexual assault"". That charge required the prosecution to prove Weinstein committed a serious sex crime against at least two women.
 
 Not guilty? Of a serious sex crime against at least two women? Seriously?
 
 Just let that sink in. Think how Sciorra, Haleyi, Mann and Dunning - whose harrowing testimony of historical sexual assault at the Weinstein trial (that fell outside the statute of limitations or occurred in another jurisdiction) was key to the prosecution's case of ""predatory"" behaviour - must be feeling today.
 
 How must Weinstein's dozens of other accusers be feeling? My heart goes out to each and every one of them.
 
 As a writer and activist who has worked extensively on issues of violence against women for 20 years and been intimately involved with the #MeToo movement here in Australia, I have always said that, at best, the Weinstein verdict could deliver some form of justice for some victims and - by proxy - others. And that it could ensure one perpetrator was held accountable, locked away and prevented from doing harm.
 
 At worst, it could highlight, yet again, the limits of a criminal justice system that is often women's only form of recourse, and its inability to tackle the broader structures that have long enabled predators such as Weinstein and silenced victims. Yes, I'll use the word predator.
 
 I have also said that the verdict, regardless of the outcome, would not be a ""referendum on #MeToo"", as some have suggested. It may be the end of a chapter, but this story is still unfinished: we still have work to do. I just hadn't expected the verdict to be such a tidy illustration of all these points.
 
 In failing to convict Weinstein on the ""predatory"" nature of his conduct, the jury illustrated that they, like so many others, may be willing to hold individual perpetrators to account in very narrowly defined circumstances, but looking at the structures and enablers that help men like Weinstein become ""predators"", declaring open season on women, is, well, still just too hard. That is the work that lies ahead.
 
 In the US, She Said, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey's account of how they broke the Weinstein story and ignited a movement, throws the work yet to do into sharp relief. We learn about the non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, that work like cover-ups. We learn how lawyers who act on behalf of victims can be complicit in a system where they derive benefit from large settlements that demand silence.
 
 We learn that sexual harassment laws in the US are weak and the statute of limitations short. We learn that the federal cap on damages ($US300,000) is comparatively low and deters lawyers from taking sexual harassment cases or prompts them to steer their clients towards more lucrative (and confidential) settlements. And we learn that the national regulator, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is weak with few powers of enforcement and utilises a confidential complaints process that enables predators and their employers to remain in the shadows.
 
 We also learn how power and money can buy you some very unlikely allies. Hello lawyer Lisa Bloom and her now infamous memo, in which she gave Weinstein advice on how to rescue his reputation.
 
 In Australia, we have not yet had that kind of forensic analysis that focuses our attention on the broader, structural issues we have yet to tackle. But that may come soon in the form of the Australian Human Rights Commission's world-first national inquiry into sexual harassment in the workplace, which has been two years in the making and is expected to report within the month.
 
 In relentlessly taking up the challenge to tackle the systems, not just the individual perpetrators - both here and around the world - we can, and I believe we will, deliver the kind of justice that eluded us and many of Weinstein's victims on Monday. In the words of actor Mira Sorvino in response to the verdict: ""The beginning of #justice. More to come, my sisters.""

79,Weinstein's lawyer gives the saddest defence of sexual assault,Fairfax,2020-02-09T01:44:29.036Z,"Maybe we need to fight for men to be considered as sexually responsible rather than dehumanise them to excuse rapists, writes Jenna Price.
 
 Maybe we do need to concentrate on men's rights. I say this after hearing the compelling interview with Donna Rotunno by Megan Twohey. Rotunno is Harvey Weinstein's lawyer and Twohey is the co-author of She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement.
 
 Twohey asks Rotunno if she's ever been sexually assaulted. Rotunno replies: ""I have not ... because I would never put myself in that position ... I have always made choices from college age on, where I never drank too much. I never went home with someone that I didn't know, I never, I just never put myself in any vulnerable circumstance, ever.""
 
 Because, Rotunno means, men can't be trusted. If women are drunk, men can't be trusted not to rape them. Men can't be trusted to take no for an answer. And men are on the hunt for the vulnerable. This is the saddest apologia for sexual violence I've ever read. Rotunno's world view is that women make themselves victims and men can't help themselves. Is this where we are in 2020?
 
 There are two significant concerns with Rotunno's argument. She blames victims for not taking enough care, for putting themselves out there. But worse for men, she says they have no agency, that men have an uncontrollable sex drive and can't control their needs.
 
 Weinstein's lawyer is not alone in thinking like that. The National Community Attitudes Survey conducted by ANROWS shows a staggering one-third of Australians believe rape results from ""men not being able to control their need for sex"". The sample size was 17,500 Australians over 16. More than one in four agree that ""when a man is very sexually aroused, he may not even realise that the woman doesn't want to have sex"".
 
 Michael Flood, associate professor in the law faculty at Queensland University of Technology, says research reveals some people still subscribe to the idea that male sexuality is an uncontrollable or barely controllable force. The weird flaw with this argument is that the majority of men are not rapists. They understand the word no. Then why do we dehumanise men in this way?
 
 It's certainly a way of shifting the responsibility from men, poor hapless water buffalo, to women, classic victim-blaming, an expression first used by William Ryan in his book Blaming the Victim, where he writes, it's a way of ""justifying inequality by finding defects in the victims of inequality"". And that's the way it is for Rotunno. Those women, they've made poor choices. Men are so helpless.
 
 Here's how Rotunno continues: ""We walk out at night and we look around and make sure we have our phones, some people take mace. We take precautions. And all I'm saying is, is that women should take precautions.""
 
 Women should take precautions because men are dangerous. This view, which blames women for sexual assault, is anti-male and constructs men as hopeless dolts led by desire.
 
 Those terrifying figures in the ANROWS survey show a decline in the numbers of those who think men can't control themselves (yes, that percentage was 43 per cent just a few years ago). But that concept of uncontrollable men makes women take all the responsibility for getting men to behave well.
 
 As Kathryn Ryan writes in Rape Mythology and Victim Blaming, ""Stereotypes operate at every stage of the legal process: victims' decisions to report, the police response, lawyers' decisions to prosecute, how defence attorneys defend the case, jury decision making, and judges' behaviour.""
 
 If you've read any of the material from the Weinstein trial, you will see how women are being painted by Rotunno and her team. I wish this only happened in the US. The Weinstein trial reminds us how hard it is for women to have to recount details of their assaults and then to have lawyers attack their credibility. No wonder some refused to testify.
 
 But those stereotypes hurt women and they hurt men. Flood says there's this idea ""women should be the gatekeepers and guardians of sexual safety, with responsibility for both their own and men's sexual behaviour"", what author Anne Summers described as God's Police. That's been used to ""deny, downplay or defend men's sexual violence against women, and to place the burden of responsibility for rape with women. It is up to women not to ""provoke"" men, to ""lead them on"", as men cannot be held responsible for their actions, Flood says.
 
 Women have spent the last 50 years fighting for agency over their lives, not to be considered as objects or less worthy. But now maybe we need to fight for men to be considered as sexually responsible, as kind and vulnerable, and that means they will need to behave that way.
 
 Rotunno's solution is that men and women should sign a consent form before having sex. Quite the idea: contract law as foreplay, where it's safer to whip out the pen than the penis.

80,Who decides who gets the gongs?,Others,2021-11-28T16:12:29.978Z,"The process of awarding Australia's highest honours is hardly transparent - but what's clear is we need diversity on the selection council as much as we need diverse recipients.
 
 I am not entirely sure why I originally got worked up about the Australian honours system. My parents, new arrivals in 1951, thought they were very important so guess it rubbed off.
 
 Pretty confident though that I wrote my first ever story about the lack of women on the list sometime last century.
 
 That part has improved - there are now many more women being honoured than there were even 10 years ago. Partly that's due to the work of Honour a Woman, a lobby group comprised of three grumpy women and many supporters who have been making their case for gender equity for years. They have also been going state to state, territory to territory, asking politicians and public servants to work harder on nominating women for Australia's highest awards (even higher honours than AFL finals or Olympic gold medals).
 
 So what does it take to score one of these honours? Turns out, you don't have to be particularly perfect. The honours system will take you and your achievements, warts and all, so long as you haven't committed a crime.
 
 Shane Stone, the chair of the Council for the Order of Australia, said this week honours would not be stripped from recipients unless the awardee has had a criminal conviction. ""Short of a criminal conviction, we are not going to be arbiters of what people can or can't say,"" he said.
 
 But there are rules around the awards - for example, an award can be removed if the recipient ""has behaved or acted in a manner that has brought disrepute on the Order"" - which make it sound broader than a criminal conviction. Much broader.
 
 Shane Stone has a long history of public service (and yes, I still believe most politicians do it because they think they can serve the public).He was the president of the federal Liberal Party, chief minister of the Northern Territory and now runs the new National Drought and Flood Agency. He is probably best known for his leaked letter which described the Howard government as ""mean, tricky and dysfunctional and out to get its own supporters"" (so, he is capable of speaking truth to power).
 
 And maybe that's why he has come out in his role as chair of the council to say it needs to be more transparent and open about the way it operates. That does not mean all of us will like what we see.
 
 Why is he telling us about the council's position on criminal convictions now? This year, we have had serial controversies about those who receive awards. In January, renowned men's rights activist Bettina Arndt scored a gong. A few weeks later, she was condemned in the Senate for her comments on the murders of a Queensland mother and three children. She tweeted: ""Congratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 'driven too far'.""
 
 Mike Carlton also copped a serve for his Queen's Birthday award, the serve relating to his abusive tweets, according to Stone. He told me it was as controversial as the award for Arndt, but that's not what the news reports say. When I used the news database Factiva to compare the pair, the search for Arndt's award revealed 246 results compared to 37 for Carlton's, using the number of newspaper stories as a measure for fury (although this sample also includes the original story of the award).
 
 There hasn't yet been a formal announcement about the Arndt and Carlton awards, although Stone's comments are a clear indication.
 
 ""We dutifully go through [all the complaints]. The base rule is unless you have committed a criminal offence, you don't lose an award ... I will be the nodding head when it all happens.""
 
 He says there is a view that he can deal with controversy: ""Send Shane out, he's got broad shoulders, he can do it.""
 
 But as he points out, most of the thousands of awards are non-controversial, which means the broad shoulders aren't required very often. Mostly this gig is about spreading pride in the achievements of Australians, which might explain why even people who have criticised the system don't knock back an honour when it comes their way. Stone estimates maybe one or two people a year decide not to accept.
 
 But as Stone points out, there is much more we can do to make the whole process more understandable. The community representatives, for example, are appointed through the Department of PM&C, and last week two new people found themselves on the council, Jillian Segal and Melinda O'Leary. Stone says he is not ""the picker"".
 
 Segal has a long history of public service, while O'Leary is far less well-known. Segal and O'Leary replace Elizabeth Broderick and Gabrielle Trainor, both of whom are understood to have opposed the Arndt award. Although Stone has told reporters that the vote for awards must be unanimous, others on the council have said it is only a majority. Which you can imagine, remembering that Bronwyn Bishop has also been on the receiving end of both an award and a controversy.
 
 As David Hardaker pointed out in his excellent series on the awards for Crikey: ""The stacking of the awards has come at the same time as more politically partisan appointments are made to the core group of 'community representatives' - the seven individuals who consider nominations and advise the Governor-General.""
 
 So it is very welcome to hear Stone say he wants the process to be more transparent. So do the fabulous folks at Honour a Woman. It would be great to see more diversity of background among the members of the council. Look right and left before crossing. Stone has overseen a shift to gender equality of council members during his tenure, a very good thing. The next move is to make sure that those who vote on Australia's highest honour (bar the rugby league grand final) reflect who we are across Australia, not just on the right across Australia.

81,"Women are losing ground, not holding it",Fairfax,2021-08-08T18:12:30.058Z,"At the start of the year, I was commissioned by the Herald to look ahead to the key issues likely to be on the ""gender agenda"" in 2020. I dutifully asked some of the smartest, most dogged gender equality advocates I know, including Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins and the national feminist icon Anne Summers, for their predictions.
 
 Both told me roughly the same thing. After the previous year had ended with Australia continuing its almost uninterrupted backwards slide in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap rankings, slipping from 15th out of 153 countries in 2006 to 44th in 2019, we needed to focus on preserving the gains women had made.
 
 'More than in the past,"" Jenkins said, ""[we] need to keep holding ground as a top priority - we can't take anything for granted"". Summers agreed: ""I just hope that everyone realises that they will have to fight harder than ever in order to gain anything new, as well as to protect what little we have already won.""
 
 Now, just past the 2020 mid-year mark, I am struck by how prescient those remarks turned out to be. Who could have anticipated that a pandemic would highlight just how fragile women's progress is - and how easily set back a generation.
 
 Who among us will heed Jenkins' and Summers' call.
 
 A not-so-fun fact: women over the age of 55 are the fastest growing portion of the homeless population. Women's economic security was deemed so important by the Coalition government that its previous minister for women, Kelly O'Dwyer, launched a strategy dedicated to shoring it up in 2018, and a successor strategy from the current minister, Marise Payne, was among the matters experts told me was hotly anticipated in 2020.
 
 Certainly, action would be timely. Women's economic security is greatly imperilled by COVID-19, as Jenkins warned earlier this year, suggesting it was ""laying the groundwork for some pretty serious poverty for women"". Women are over-represented among the COVID-related job and in part-time or insecure work, and they are more likely to be working fewer hours as they take on additional unpaid pandemic-related domestic and care work. And women are raiding their already significantly smaller super accounts.
 
 The gender pay gap has inched up to 14 per cent, figures released yesterday by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency show. They came with an ominous warning from the agency's director, Libby Lyons: ""Over the period of the GFC, our last economic downturn, the gender pay gap shot up 2 percentage points from 15.6 per cent in November 2007 to 17.6 per cent in November 2009. It took us 10 years to bring that pay gap back down to where it is today. We cannot afford to see a repeat of this as we face our first economic recession in almost 30 years. It will be a disaster for the economy and a calamity for Australian women.""
 
 This government seems blissfully unaware or completely uninterested, proposing a ""blokecovery"" to what is clearly a ""she-cession"", investing in male-dominated industries such as construction. It is also forging ahead with a ""snap-back"" to pre-pandemic childcare fees after a brief experiment with the feminist Nirvana of ""free"" childcare.
 
 Since the pandemic began, just under 5 per cent of Marise Payne's public tweets, including media statements, have had anything at all to do with women and COVID-19. (I crunched the numbers.)
 
 This week Payne convened an online Women and Jobs Forum to ""help boost women's workforce participation"", a deliverable under the 2018 Women's Economic Security statement. Her office offered scant details, when I asked, about who was involved and what was discussed. And the minister declined to answer whether the ""forum"" welcomed enough people to engage in a discussion that affects half the population. Does this government take us for fools?
 
 Unless we collectively fight our corner, we can only expect more of the same.

82,Women key to economic recovery,Fairfax,2020-06-09T11:55:47.385Z,"Greater flexibility and reduced childcare costs will lift women's participation in the workforce.
 
 As Melburnians emerge from the depths of the lockdown, there is a sense that more things have changed than the colour of the leaves. But which changes will be permanent and which will be swept away as we slowly return to ""normal""?
 
 For those of us lucky enough to still be in work, the biggest shift has been from working in an office block to working at our kitchen tables. Spending more time at home has changed some household dynamics, but reinforced many others. Siblings seem to be fighting less, but it is once again women doing most of the caring. The Prime Minister declared in the great school debate that he didn't want Australians choosing between working and caring for their children, but the latest unemployment figures reveal that women have done just that. With participation in the job market dropping to levels last seen in 2004, women were 50 per cent more likely to have stopped looking for work than men.
 
 The economic impact on women from the pandemic is mounting as one of the biggest issues for the recovery. Professions dominated by women, including retail, hospitality and education, have been hardest hit by the lockdown. Added to this are the additional caring responsibilities the lockdown has generated and women are working more but being paid less.
 
 Last month's Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show men reduced their hours of paid work 7.5 per cent, and women 11.5 per cent. This drop in employment will affect women's short-term financial security but also their long-term economic engagement.
 
 If the pandemic leads to a permanent widening of the gap between male and female employment, it will undermine the economic recovery. With the drop in international migration removing the population from the three P's of economic growth, we will have to rely on the other two: participation and productivity. Women are the key to this equation.
 
 A 2018 McKinsey report estimates closing the gap on female participation in the workforce to the best in our region - the Philippines - would increase the size of the Australian economy by 12 per cent in 2025. There is no other economic reform with this type of pay-off. The benefits do not just come from extra workers. Gender diversity increases the productivity of the entire workforce.
 
 In the gloom of the economic ruin of COVID-19 there is hope that in rebuilding our economy we can better utilise the skills and experience of women. Our current model of work developed at a time when only one person, a man, in the household was in paid employment. That has changed: 70 per cent of families now have two earners. But the way we work and the way we care has remained rigid, putting families, and women in particular, under pressure.
 
 New ways of working allow women and men to better navigate work and family responsibilities. Not only have studies found workplaces with greater flexibility improve productivity, but flexibility is also a key driver in women returning to the workforce after having children.
 
 Greater flexibility has been a gradual process in Australian workplaces. Those working from home often miss out on opportunities at work and promotions. If we can retain the normalisation of new flexible work practices for men and women, we will remove these penalties and make a giant step towards gender equity. There is, of course, a risk that all flexible working does is help women do everything. There is also a need for a renegotiation at home about who does the care work. In my favourite statistic from COVID-19, nearly half of men in New York claimed they did most of the home-schooling - 3 per cent of women agreed.
 
 The other revolution brought about from COVID-19 has been free childcare. Once seen as the utopian dream of a socialist Australia, it is now underpinning our capitalist recovery. Childcare costs are the biggest financial barrier for women with young children increasing their participation in the workforce. Women can end up keeping just 10¢ in every extra dollar earned from a day's work. Grattan Institute modelling recently showed increasing childcare subsidies for low-income earners could help grow the economy by $11 billion a year. With reports even the beancounters at Treasury in Canberra are calling for some form of free childcare to be retained, you know the economic case for cheaper childcare and increased female participation in the workforce is strong.
 
 As we emerge from hibernation, if we can resist the urge to ditch changes brought by COVID-19 that have heralded greater flexibility and reduced costs of working for women, we can bring the possibility of equity into a reality not for distant descendants, but our daughters. That is a change we would all like to see.

83,Women's rights make men worry - and the problem is?,Fairfax,2021-07-12T20:54:19.785Z,"It's marching season. While there are definite signs the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is gathering about it fringe dwellers with an earnest nastiness, who have switched the wit and sass of a posse of Bronwyn Bishops in favour of drab, unfunny Scott Morrison parodies, who could deny the community, for the most part, has a wow of a time enjoying itself, its successes, excesses and its many parts on one night of the year?
 
 It is an acquired taste for some people, of course, the mardi gras parade, but nobody much is worrying about whether all those sequins and leathers put the rights of heterosexual people at risk and force us to change our behaviour or give up our jobs, so that we, boring straights, are no longer sure of who we are.
 
 We certainly need to be more respectful of LBTQIs, but that's modern manners you would have hoped. Today there will be another march, for a group much larger than even the ever-expanding acronym of the queer community, and I fear there won't be a sequin in sight. It is International Women's Day tomorrow, marked with the now-traditional Saturday march starting at Hyde Park. What started out as a communist rally became a socialist day of industrial demands and is now highly regarded globally as a time to reflect on the achievements of women and what remains to be done to achieve equality of opportunity between the sexes.
 
 There are those, however, whose brows wrinkle as they worry that women's rights might have gone too far. They do not insist that women are biologically incapable of leadership or courage, or that it is unnatural and damaging to the tradition of motherhood, as the traditional opponents of gender equality have done. Their concern is for young men, often their sons, and the impact this is all having on them. How they are no longer sure of who they are and whether it is still respectable and good to be a man.
 
 The truth is, of course, that gender equality does require men and women to regard each other differently and act accordingly. The truth is that this will be uncomfortable because change always is.
 
 It's been difficult for women; they, too, have changed their behaviour, although the job's not done. My family was mortified when I did not change my name when I married in 1973. My mother and mother-in-law-to-be told me that they'd been proud enough of their husbands to take their names. Placing young children in childcare was met with rebuke, too. Female reporters asking questions at noisy press conferences took some doing, as has saying no to making the tea in the office.
 
 Young women often lament that, although lovers are plentiful, commitment from a man is more elusive; career women complain they swapped one career for two if they worked and had children - make that three if you count the housework. And there is absolutely no doubt that modern sexuality has as many traps in it for women as men. Some are even the same old traps, where girls who sleep around are tarts while the boys are studs. But there are many more.
 
 I am always pleased when young men say they are now worried about doing the right thing; it's better to be worried than not to care. They soon work it out - sticking to being respectful, engaging brain before engaging mouth or hands, is always a good start. The wider question of not being sure what a young man today should be is not feminist-imposed neurosis but a very sensible response to the changing rules
 
 of engagement.
 
 If we are to treat women differently then, by default, we change ourselves. Who would have thought it, but gender equality does require mutual respect instead of comments about great tits and paying her less for the trouble. There should be no fear in this; feminism takes nothing away from men's ability to achieve, although there's more competition and they need to work harder for it.
 
 Equality demands evidence-based decision-making replace bias and group think - a familiar refrain in any standard management textbook. It takes nothing away from men's comforts or choices. In fact, it adds to them. These days, a man with a dishcloth in his hand is a sex symbol every bit as much as the bloke with the muscles or the smooth-talking Prince Charming. These days it's OK for men to marry up. And although there's still resistance to men as the primary parent, it's on its way.
 
 None of this denies the inevitability of the standard deviations of men's and women's choices; on average men and women will make different ones. What it does is allow for individuals to make their own choices and for the rules, both written and unwritten, to enable, protect and support them.
 
 I just hope there are a few sequins on Saturday.

84,Words that hurt: What's in a name?,Fairfax,2021-07-10T13:29:05.175Z,"Karen"" is not an actual woman but rather has come to denote a pejorative stereotype, much to the chagrin (and occasional mirth) of the multitudes of women who, through no fault of their own, were named Karen at birth.
 
 Karen was chosen precisely because it is a ""generic white woman name"", and the term is used to refer to a privileged, middle-class, middle-aged white woman who uses her social power to bully those lower on the socio-economic food chain.
 
 Karen is the woman who harangues a poorly paid shop assistant over a perceived ""issue"" and asks to ""speak to the manager"". She lacks any self-awareness that she is not the victim of an injustice but rather is perpetrating one herself.
 
 She has strong soccer-mum vibes and probably listens to pop radio on the school run. She may be an anti-vaxxer. She even has a particular haircut associated with her.
 
 Karen's whiteness is important - the trope entered the mainstream via the United States as a way of mocking and calling out the phenomenon of privileged, racist women complaining about, or calling the police on, black people who were going about their business.
 
 One of the most egregious examples of Karen-ing was the case of Amy Cooper. The New York woman was walking her dog in Central Park on May 25 when a fellow walker asked her to leash her dog. Cooper rang the police and cried there was ""an African-American man ... threatening me and threatening my dog"". She was later charged with making a false report.
 
 Karen has even been given the literary treatment - the recently published Such a Fun Age by Kiley Reid is the story of a black babysitter who works for a privileged white woman. Alix wants to project an image of progressive positivity, but has a Karen-esque incident deep in her past.
 
 This week the novel was long-listed for the Man Booker prize, elevating Karen to the annals of literature.
 
 But while it has its origins in race politics and casual racism, Karen has morphed, particularly in the Australian context, to mean any white woman who complains and makes life difficult for service personnel in particular.
 
 What did she do this week?
 
 This week Karen starred in her breakthrough Australian role, when she walked into a Bunnings store in Melbourne and staged a deliberate confrontation with staff over her refusal to wear a mask. The woman (actually named Kerry Nash) filmed the whole encounter, in which she argues with staff about her ""rights"" and tells them: ""You're discriminating against me!""
 
 She makes threats to sue them. In a perversion of the Karen theme, instead of demanding to speak to the manager, Nash is referred to the manager by the hapless Bunnings worker she originally confronts.
 
 Subsequent media reports showed the woman was a serial crank. On Twitter she was widely condemned, given the hashtag #BunningsKaren and for a brief moment she unified an increasingly fractious population in contempt for her.
 
 Previously, our best Australian Karen was a woman in Mildura who actually was named Karen and tried to tear down the Aboriginal flag her neighbours had on proud display.
 
 ""Take this s--- down, it's a disgrace,"" she says, on the video taken of the confrontation.
 
 What is notable with the Bunnings incident is the calm dignity of those being picked on by the Karen. Their patience and equanimity serve to heighten the obnoxiousness of her behaviour.
 
 What do you do if your name is actually Karen?
 
 Many of the world's real Karens - those who have the name on their birth certificate - can laugh along at the joke.
 
 But others are pushing back against the term, which they say vilifies them.
 
 Plenty of women (and men) not named Karen also object to the term. They say it is sexist and nasty, a way of denigrating middle-aged (white) women as ridiculous - seeing as they are past their sexual use-by date - and of silencing them.
 
 Some argue that for millennia women have fought for the right to speak up for themselves without being labelled shrill and shrewish.
 
 Women in their 40s might have just found their voice, only to realise that the patriarchy has come up with a new and different way to tell them to shut up.
 
 But that's the problem with Karens complaining about being called Karens.
 
 They just get called a Karen again, and the Karen cycle spins on.",760
85,A better way than just locking up,Others,2020-10-18T23:27:07.768Z,"Incarcerating people may make the community safer in the short term, but merely throwing people in prison without sustainable rehabilitation methods achieves very little in the long run.
 
 There are many reasons people living in the ACT can feel proud of our record in leading the country, but particularly when it comes to law reform.
 
 In 2004, we were the first jurisdiction to pass a Human Rights Act. Last month the ACT Legislative Assembly showed that it would do more to protect our most vulnerable citizens - our children.
 
 By becoming the first jurisdiction in Australia to endorse raising the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14, the ACT has shown that it is the clear leader in Australian criminal justice reform, bringing the territory into line with United Nations standards.
 
 However, broader reform is sorely needed.
 
 Australia now imprisons more people than at any time since 1900, in both total number and per capita, at a cost exceeding $3.5 billion annually and equating to $302 per prisoner per day, or $110,000 per year.
 
 Imprisonment rates are rising in the ACT, as they are across the nation. Over the past decade, the ACT has recorded the fastest-growing prison population in Australia, as well as the highest rates of recidivist and unsentenced prisoners.
 
 No one is saying there is no place for prisons, and many in the community would agree that there presently exists little option but incarceration for those who have committed the most despicable of crimes.
 
 However, prisons tend to institutionalise people - and people who leave the prison system often graduate to being lifetime criminals.
 
 There has to be a better way.
 
 Instead of expanding the Alexander Maconochie Centre, the ACT government has committed to a justice reinvestment approach to reduce recidivism by 25 per cent by 2025, working with and strengthening communities, instead of building more prisons.
 
 This target is commendable and achievable. There is much to be proud of in the ACT government's justice strategy, which recognises that rehabilitation is cheaper and more beneficial than building more prisons and far more effective in reducing reoffending and keeping our community safe.
 
 Persistently high recidivism rates show us that jailing is failing, so we need to work harder to convince the rest of the country that reform is needed.
 
 Incarcerating people may make the community safer in the short term, but merely locking people up, instead of diverting them from the court and prison system, without sustainable rehabilitation methods, achieves very little in the long run.
 
 Overcrowding and lack of resources mean education and reintegration programs, as well as essential counselling and behaviour management courses, are too often pushed aside because ""lockdown"" is easier to manage.
 
 There is an avalanche of evidence from experts and governments of all political persuasions that says reform to our traditional criminal justice system leads to better economic and social outcomes.
 
 This is particularly important if we are serious about ending the disproportionate impact of imprisonment on our most vulnerable populations, particularly youth, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and people with mental illness and cognitive disability.
 
 Across the country, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people represent 28 per cent of the prison population, despite making up only 3 per cent of the wider Australian population.
 
 The ACT sadly reflects this trend, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders comprising 22 per cent of our adult prisoner population last year, but less than 2 per cent of the total ACT population.
 
 Three decades after the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, we have seen little substantial progress on the criminal justice, corrective service and policing reforms it recommended.
 
 COVID-19 has shaken our world and given many of us an opportunity to think about the kind of world we want to live in.
 
 Is that a world where children as young as 10 can be locked up? Where those born into the most difficult circumstances are pushed down further into the cycle of disadvantage by a punitive, not restorative, justice system?
 
 The clear and overdue need for reform has prompted a new multipartisan group to join the chorus of voices advocating for change in our criminal justice system.
 
 Launched earlier this month, with former governors-general Dame Quentin Bryce and Sir William Deane as patrons-in-chief, the Justice Reform Initiative is a broad alliance which includes former judges, prosecutors, police, respected Aboriginal leaders and former ministers from both sides of politics - many of whom have witnessed how the overuse of jail leads to worse outcomes for our society, not better.
 
 Spanning the fields of government, justice, corrections, academia, and social and community work, this alliance seeks an unbiased, evidence-based examination of the role imprisonment plays in our justice system, because locking people up does not always work.
 
 The ACT government's move to support raising the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 is a significant step towards a better justice system.
 
 It is the start of a journey that we hope will continue beyond October, regardless of who wins the ACT election.
 
 The ACT needs to continue leading the way for the rest of Australia.
 
 A smarter, better justice system is one we all deserve.

86,A signpost to Victoria's conflicted past,Fairfax,2020-04-20T03:10:48.284Z,"Aitken Street is the main street in Gisborne in the Macedon Ranges. I've walked up and down it for many years.
 
 While statues are a highly visible means of marking history, street signs are markers too. Follow a street sign and you can be following a stream through history.
 
 Aitken Street is a signpost to Victoria's conflicted past.
 
 It is named after John Aitken. A contemporary of John Batman, he landed on the shore of Port Phillip in 1836 with sheep from Tasmania and made his way to what is now Gisborne. He carved out of what he undoubtedly thought was no one's land, an empire built on the sheep's back, and the dispossession of Indigenous rights to that land. He claimed thousands of hectares. He built a formidable reputation for his management of his flock and the quality of his wool.
 
 He was, at first, in his own words, ""conciliatory"" to the ""natives"", but within a couple of years he had narrowly missed the cut of a tomahawk and was ""attacked by about 40 natives at my station. They came to me armed with spears and their guns"". Contemporary accounts say ""Aitken would not permit the Aborigines to trespass on his run"". Aitken, in failing health, returned to England in 1858 and died that October.
 
 His was a time in Victoria defined by conquest, cruelty, conscience and minuscule and ineffectual kindness.
 
 The month Aitken died, a report was produced for the Legislative Council on ""the state of the Aborigine in the colony"". The preamble ends: ""The general tenor of the evidence will bear out the conclusion which your committee have arrived at that while the Aborigines are endued with keen perceptive faculties, there is a considerable deficiency in their reflective faculties, and a certain want of steadiness of purpose in their characters, which appears the great obstacle to be overcome in reclaiming them, and bringing them within the pale of civilisation and Christianity."" The Indigenous tribes were, in settlers' eyes, aliens upon the land. The report was at least clear-sighted about one thing: the destruction of the Indigenous people. The was caused by ""occupation"" of the land by the white population, says the report - and without a hint of irony, to ""vices acquired by contact with a civilised race, more particularly the indulgence in ardent spirits; and hunger, in consequence of the scarcity of game since the settlement of the colony; and, also in some cases, to cruelty and ill-treatment"".
 
 It acknowledges that ""great injustice has been perpetrated upon the Aborigines - that, when the government of the colony found it necessary to take from them their hunting grounds and their means of living, proper provision should have been made for them."" The thought that it benefits no one to measure one culture against another did not enter the colonists' heads. Pity was the prime motivator of their stance, even when it came into conflict with the progression of their civilisation. ""Victoria is now entirely occupied by a superior race, and there is scarcely a spot, excepting in the remote mountain ranges, or dense scrubs, on which the Aborigine can rest his weary feet. To allow this to continue would be to tolerate and perpetuate a great moral wrong; and your committee are of opinion that, even at this late period, a vigorous effort should be made to provide for the remnants of the various tribes, so that they may be maintained in comparative plenty.""
 
 Thus is the indifference of conquest reconciled with the diffidence of conscience.
 
 Last week, in Aitken Street, excavation work for a new store had to be halted while a survey of the site's Aboriginal significance was conducted. ""ALDI, in conjunction with the Wurundjeri people, is assessing the cultural sensitivity of the land in which the Gisborne store will be built,"" ALDI told the ABC.
 
 It's been a long, desperate road of lamentation and survival to reach this point. The past is not a foreign country. The recent marches have shown that.
 
 The road we take is built on the stones of our history.

87,A special Sydney place shows why history matters,Fairfax,2020-07-11T06:47:47.494Z,"On the day the federal Education Minister Dan Tehan announced a major shake-up of higher education funding, especially humanities degrees, I found myself following a creek in a patch of suburban bushland near Campbelltown. The timing wasn't deliberate, but it was a relief to briefly escape from news that predicted alarming changes to university history teachers and researchers like myself.
 
 After roaring down the motorway, this little piece of remnant bushland was an oasis. Walking and forestry tracks criss-cross the quiet valley. Clear winter sunlight reaches down between eucalypt and angophora trees. After a horror summer of drought and fire, recent rains have given the understorey a burst of maidenhair, bracken shoots and spectacular fungi. The only sounds come from the running creek and the breathless croaking of frogs.
 
 This is also a special historical place. In 1788, the newly established colony of Sydney was facing an uncertain future.
 
 Imagine this valley back then. The bushland wasn't a sliver - the colony was. Perched on the edge of the Eora nation, colonists wrestled with failing crops and unpredictable fishing hauls, as well as the news their supply ship had crashed on route to Sydney.
 
 When some of the colony's precious cattle escape into the bush from their pen in June 1788, First Fleet officer Watkin Tench described the loss with a desperate sense of Sydney's future: ""An accident happened which I record with much regret,"" he laments in his history of early Sydney.
 
 ""The whole of our black cattle, consisting of five cows and a bull, either from not being properly secured or from the negligence of those appointed to take care of them, strayed into the woods and in spite of all the search we have been able to make, are not yet found.""
 
 The escaped cows leave the British teetering on the verge of starvation.
 
 Australian history is far from pre-determined and this escaped mob of cattle is a terrifying symbol of that initial precarity.
 
 But the cows didn't disappear. They marched off westwards and were watched. The black bull was drawn onto the wall of an overhang by this little creek near what's now known as Campbelltown, proof of their escapade into Dharug and Dharawal country. Remnants of it are still visible - the cloved hoof, the huge pizzle.
 
 But the layers of Sydney's history and people's attitudes to it are also visible on the cave wall. The bull is spray-painted in graffiti - ""this is BULLshit"" insists one crude tagger. It's one of the most significant contact art sites in the whole of Sydney. It links all of us back to a time when what we have now was far from certain.
 
 And yet here it sits, defaced, in a beautiful forest in western Sydney. It feels like such a waste.
 
 If we took up historian Bruce Pascoe's invitation to connect with Indigenous knowledge, Bull Cave could be a link for all of us to our country and its history. It could be a treasure, rather than an awful scar.
 
 At one level, the vandalism is a reminder that some people simply don't care. But at another, it shows us history matters deeply - the erasure of Aboriginal history-making was the intent.
 
 The past few weeks have demonstrated this paradox of history. Statues have been torn down and walled in. Hundreds of thousands of citizens have marched for rights and recognition.
 
 Meanwhile, an Aboriginal site dating to antiquity was dynamited and a government told young Australians that history isn't as important as dentistry or engineering because it's not ""job ready"". But without understanding our past and its layers of history-making and erasure, what hope have we got?

88,A squabble about indigenous identity has brought one of the key participants undone,News,2021-04-29T16:47:41.528Z,"For Bruce Pascoe, a public challenge to his origins is part of the ‘colonial tactic’
 
 Furious debate. Paige Taylor, The Australian, Wednesday: Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt has sacked his one-time friend and ally Josephine Cashman amid a furious debate over Aboriginal identity … Mr Wyatt was said to have been blindsided by Ms Cashman’s email to Peter Dutton.
 
 Taylor again, The Weekend Australian, January 11: The Australian Federal Police is assessing an allegation that celebrated author and historian Bruce Pascoe has benefited financially from wrongly claiming to be indigenous. One of Professor Pascoe’s most vocal critics, Aboriginal entrepreneur Josephine Cashman, asked Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton for an investigation of Professor Pascoe for alleged “dishonesty offences” … Pascoe was joint winner of the $30,000 inaugural Indigenous Writers’ Prize in the NSW Premier’s Literary Awards in 2016.
 
 A hurtful allegation. Alexandra Humphries, ABC, Monday: Author and historian Bruce Pascoe has described the referral of an allegation disputing his Aboriginal heritage to the Australian Federal Police as “hurtful”, saying he has never met the complainant … Pascoe has been fighting bushfires in Mallacoota for the past few weeks.
 
 No doubts about his identity. Jack Latimore, NITV, Sunday: Pascoe is undeniably Aboriginal: he identifies as indigenous; maintains that he has in his possession documents that confirm he is of Aboriginal descent; and he is acknowledged and vouched for by senior Yuin lore men.
 
 Never met her. David Killick, Hobart’s The Mercury, Monday: Mr Pascoe said he did not know the woman who had made the allegations against him — but he rejected them entirely. “It’s part of the colonial tactic. Unfortunately, some of our own people get involved but it’s part of the trauma, the backwash of the trauma of losing a land that belonged to our people for 120,000 years at least and suddenly you are the generation who lost it, lost control of it. That trauma isn’t finished in 230 years. We’re still experiencing it. And I’ve got no doubt that for many Australians, the amount of Aboriginal blood in my family is too little to worry about.”
 
 Adam Morton, Guardian Australia, Saturday: His son, Jack Pascoe, said: “We stand by the identity of our family. The insinuation that my father has fabricated his heritage is hard to take because for him it’s an issue that has been part of the public discourse for 40 years.”
 
 Wide circle. Andrew Bolt, Herald Sun, December 5 last year: Pascoe did not publicly claim he was Aboriginal until after a critic said his novel would be better if he did. Since then he has claimed his great-grandmother on his mother’s side was Aboriginal, only to later say she was English (presuming he was referring to the same person). Despite that, he has gone on to claim links with at least six Aboriginal tribes from five states.
 
 Richard Guilliatt, The Weekend Australian Magazine, May 25 last year:Bruce Pascoe likes to tell a good yarn, and one of his better ones concerns the time his long-running conflict with academia accidentally turned him into our most influential indigenous historian … not long after Pascoe began vehemently proclaiming that generations of Australians had been duped by their history books into the false belief that Aboriginal people were nothing more than spear-throwing nomads before white colonisers arrived here.",579
89,A voice for First Nations should be beyond the reach of the judiciary,News,2020-10-10T06:57:09.889Z,"To those concerned to uphold the Constitution, protect parliamentary supremacy over policy matters and minimise legal uncertainty following the Love decision, I offer the following cautions with respect to indigenous recognition.
 
 There are ways to avoid irresponsible constitutional change, but deceptively simple symbolic solutions create more problems than they solve.
 
 First, you can’t simply remove the race power and expect it not to lead to unpredictable judicial interpretations of the Constitution, as the Institute of Public Affairs irresponsibly suggests.
 
 Removing the race power requires an appropriate replacement power to ensure parliament retains its legislative authority with respect to indigenous affairs. Removing it without replacement would create legal uncertainty.
 
 Morgan Begg’s suggestion in this space last week that parliament should rely on the “external affairs” power instead is ill-advised.
 
 This is essentially asking the High Court to determine whether Australia’s domestic indigenous affairs policies, including native title, appropriately adapt Australia’s international human rights obligations to domestic circumstances.
 
 Laws found by the High Court to be inconsistent with international law could then be invalidated. Those who value Australian parliamentary supremacy over contentious domestic policy should understand this is an irresponsible suggestion. Given their criticism of the majority in Love, the IPA argument is especially odd.
 
 This case involved judicial interpretation of the aliens power. The majority held that Aboriginal people are not aliens, which means Aboriginal non-citizens — a very small group –— can’t be deported.
 
 The decision slightly narrows parliament’s legislative capacity under the aliens power. While other powers would likely support deportation of any non-citizens (including the immigration power or the race power — as elucidated by Justice Stephen Gageler), various commentators, including the IPA, are unhappy that parliament’s power has been curtailed and legal uncertainty created.
 
 Strangely, however, the IPA condemn the Love decision, while simultaneously suggesting we curtail parliament’s power further and enliven even more unpredictable judicial interpretation by removing the race power without replacement.
 
 While other powers might theoretically be available to support lawmaking for indigenous affairs, the IPA’s approach would lead to unnecessary litigation, uncertainty and restriction of parliament’s policy discretion.
 
 The IPA’s ideological argument dangerously disregards practical legal consequences. Such an approach is inappropriate.
 
 Ours is not an ideological Constitution but a practical and pragmatic rule book. In assessing constitutional reforms, we need to be practical and cautious — not ideological.
 
 Morally, we must also heed how indigenous people want to be recognised. Removing references to “race” is not indigenous recognition, as the IPA suggests. The Uluru statement rejected this approach, just as it rejected mere symbolism.
 
 Begg and I agree on one thing, however. A “minimalist” model, like a new preamble, would increase legal uncertainty.
 
 A symbolic insertion would be justiciable. True constitutional conservatives will not support a symbolic insertion for this reason.
 
 Former prime minister John Howard tried to address this problem through a “no legal effect” clause accompanying his failed preamble in 1999, but some suggest such a caveat would be ineffective. Besides, what’s the point of putting something into the Constitution — a practical, working document — if is not intended to have any practical ­effect?
 
 We need to close the gap. Mere symbolism would be a waste of constitutional reform.
 
 The fact is, there are no slapdash solutions to indigenous constitutional recognition. Removing the race clauses is far from simple; any symbolic insertion is far from simple. Both approaches will enliven High Court uncertainty.
 
 How can High Court uncertainty be minimised? To understand a way forward, government must understand the difference between constitutional justiciability and non-justiciability.
 
 Only one model was specifically developed to fully respect parliamentary supremacy and eliminate High Court uncertainty. We need to heed the profound wisdom and pragmatism of the Uluru statement in this respect.
 
 A First Nations constitutional voice, as the Referendum Council recommended, is intended to be non-justiciable. This is key. It means it could be drafted to emulate existing non-justiciable constitutional clauses, which the High Court refrains from adjudicating because they concern “proposed laws”.
 
 The High Court’s role is to deal with laws, not proposed laws. A First Nations voice cannot be a veto. It cannot curtail parliament’s power. It should create a political, non-justiciable constitutional guarantee, which respects parliamentary supremacy. Non-justiciability is a subtle point, but crucially important.
 
 Those of good will, who want to achieve constitutional recognition without encouraging legal uncertainty, need to comprehend non-justiciability.
 
 When you understand the fundamental difference between a constitutional guarantee that is adjudicated by the High Court, and a political constitutional guarantee that is adjudicated by parliament, you will understand the modest yet profound potential of a First Nations constitutional voice.
 
 Let’s not overreact about Love. Let’s not jump to silly, deceptively simple, symbolic solutions that create more problems than they solve. Let’s work together to achieve the Uluru statement in a way that upholds the Constitution, respects parliamentary supremacy, eliminates legal uncertainty and unifies the country.Shireen Morris is a constitutional lawyer, McKenzie Postdoctoral Fellow at Melbourne Law School and senior adviser to Cape York Institute.

90,ABC IGNORES RACE TRUTHS,News,2020-12-12T04:25:04.968Z,"IT SEEMS not enough that race riots are burning the United States. On Monday the ABC broadcast yet again — unchallenged — an incitement of violent race protest here, too.
 
 This time its Q&A program invited Meyne Wyatt, who identifies as Aboriginal and calls Australia Day “Garbage Day”, to vent his rage at a country that’s made him a celebrated actor.
 
 What followed on a program laughably called “Hard Truths” was yet another example of how our civilisation is being destroyed from within — its history trashed, its people vilified and its crimes invented.
 
 Wyatt first defended the rioting in America: “There are riots, and people are talking about order? Who cares about order if there’s no justice?” He then turned to the “demands” of Aborigines that this Logie-nominated actor presumed to represent.
 
 “We want justice. I’m sick of talking about being in order, ‘cause you know what? It doesn’t work. Being peaceful — peaceful protests — don’t work.” To me, that seemed not just a defence of violent protests, but an incitement. Yet not a single person on the panel, which included Labor frontbencher Jim Chalmers and Liberal MP Andrew Bragg, challenged Wyatt or said peaceful protests do work in the right cause. See what Gandhi achieved. Look at Martin Luther King Jr. Or Christ.
 
 Nor did Q&A host Hamish Macdonald, another ABC Leftist, object to this seeming call to arms.
 
 As for the three other panellists, forget it. The ABC had again picked strident race warriors — people guaranteed to raise dangerous passions in these tense times.
 
 One was another actor, Nakkiah Lui, who on the ABC last year screamed at the audience: “F … Whitey! S..t on your colonisation … burn this place to the ground!” On Monday, Lui claimed whites, particularly white police, were racists who were killing Aborigines and needed to be told this was wrong.
 
 “We’re not crying out for justice, Hamish. We’re saying, ‘Don’t kill us’. We don’t want to be killed because we’re black.” Again, not one person on the show told Lui she was peddling a false and inflammatory stereotype.
 
 The biggest killers of Aborigines are not white people but other Aborigines. From 1991 to 2012, Aborigines murdered 765 Aborigines, as well as 230 non-Aborigines. Non-Aborigines murdered 101 Aborigines, and they went to jail for it.
 
 The final member of Monday’s panel was Nyadol Nyuon, a Sudanese-born lawyer who Australia took in as a refugee.
 
 Aborigines, Nyuon declared, “watched their children killed”, presumably by whites.
 
 “I am sorry that I did not know the name, even a single name, of the 400 people that were murdered (in custody).” Nyuon, too, was not corrected by the panel or host.
 
 Nor has one premier or police chief rebutted this toxic falsehood that’s been peddled several times lately on the ABC and by Leftist groups such as GetUp and Change.org. They seem too filled with self-loathing or too scared of appearing racist to defend Australia with the truth.
 
 No, police and prison warders have not “killed” 432 Aborigines in custody since 1991. The vast majority of those deaths were from natural causes, and almost all the rest from suicides.
 
 In fact, Aborigines in jail are less likely to die there than are white prisoners, and that’s been so for every one of the last 17 years, says the Australian Institute of Criminology.
 
 Why are these facts buried? Why are the new race baiters not contradicted by the people we pay to defend our society and civilisation?
 
 Instead, the ABC — captured by our deeply alienated Left — routinely trashes Australia and gives the microphone to such preachers of hatred and even violence.
 
 Last year, for instance, Q&A hosted Ashton Applewhite, an “anti-ageism” activist, who also defended political violence: “If that’s what it takes, that’s what it takes.” Nayuka Gorrie, a race activist who identifies as Aboriginal, used that same program to call for Australia to be torched.
 
 “We’ve tried for 230-plus years to appeal to the colonisers’ morality which doesn’t seem to exist,” she sneered.
 
 “I think violence is OK because if someone is trying to kill you, there’s no amount of ‘Oh, but I’m really clever’ … is going to save you, so, yeah, let’s burn stuff.” Then, too, no panellist contradicted her. Nor did host Fran Kelly.So who are the real racists?
 
 Could it be the race baiters now telling wild untruths on the ABC about racist “whiteys” and murderous white police, as white presenters sit mute, too scared, too self-hating or too patronising to contradict a black speaker?

91,Abuse in WA must be stopped,News,2021-06-21T01:00:33.527Z,"Police are in a strong position to judge the best options
 
 While national attention focuses on the fire emergency, especially in the southeast, an ongoing tragedy at the opposite end of the continent is too serious to overlook. Children’s lives and safety are at stake from chronic abuse in their own homes. For several days, indigenous affairs editor Paige Taylor has reported on a proposal by Western Australia Police Commissioner Chris Dawson for blanket restrictions on alcohol sales across the Kimberley, including the tourist hubs of Broome and Kununurra, for the sake of health, welfare and law and order. Under the proposal, bottle shops would be banned from selling anything but light beer. Full- and mid-strength beer, wine and spirits would be limited to restaurants, pubs and other ­licensed premises.
 
 Family assaults in the northwest more than doubled in the six years between 2012 and 2018 — from 83 a month, or a total of 996 in 2012 to 228 a month or a total of 2740 for 2018. This is despite the fact that fewer than 35,000 people live in the remote towns and communities of the Kimberley. Mr Dawson’s officers consulted indigenous leaders and frontline workers before he asked the state director of liquor licensing for the blanket ban. Half the Kimberley’s residents are indigenous. As senior Jaru woman Doreen Green, who successfully campaigned for a ban on full- and mid-strength takeaway in her home town of Halls Creek 10 years ago, said, it was wrong to describe the proposed alcohol restrictions as racist. It was a human rights issue, she said. Ms Green saw the effects of alcohol abuse on children when she taught in Halls Creek in 2002. She acted then because her students, aged seven and eight, were exposed to family violence and sleep-deprived.
 
 Experience shows such restrictions are effective. Similar action in other parts of the region, such as the small inland Kimberley town of Fitzroy Crossing 12 years ago, resulted in emergency hospital presentations falling 36 per cent in the first year. A subsequent study found the world’s highest rate of foetal ­alcohol spectrum disorder among children born in and around the area before the restrictions WA Police was prompted to investigate the extent of alcohol-related crime and harm in the Kimberley after State Coroner Ros Fogliani’s report in February 2019 into the suicides of 13 indigenous children and young people in the region between 2012 and 2016. Almost all the children and young persons who had taken their own lives had grown up in homes marred by high levels of alcohol abuse. In Kununurra, about 70 local children are periodically in trouble with police for crimes they commit in small groups while roaming at night. At least one child has said he preferred a jail cell to going home.Mr Dawson’s proposal is at odds with the McGowan Labor government and the Australian Hotels Association, which favour the establishment of a banned-drinkers register instead. A register has been in place in the Northern Territory since 2017 and is designed to block known problem drinkers at the point of sale. Experience with the BDR has been mixed. The system can be beaten, with friends buying alcohol for those who have been struck off. Police in the Kimberley favour region-wide ­restrictions to thwart sly-groggers transporting alcohol hundreds of kilometres and selling it at inflated prices. They are best placed to judge the most effective strategies.",591
92,Activist High Court takes nation into tricky territory,News,2020-12-06T08:32:37.103Z,"Shock decision raises prospect of revolt on indigenous voice
 
 In his address to federal parliament on Monday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo warned “identity politics is a threat to democracy” because it leads to hatred, fear and conflict. The next day the High Court rolled in with a landmark decision that up-ends the meaning of “aliens” in the Constitution and spreads a judicial vibe from the historic Mabo decision into migration cases and who knows where else. The court, albeit split 4-3, has taken an adventure ride with identity politics and the shocks will spread across our land. The Morrison government said the decision created “a new category of persons”, neither an alien nor citizen. Legal expert Anne Twomey, writing in our pages on Wednesday, argued it could create special rights or privileges for Aboriginal people, even a race-based constitutional distinction.
 
 The court was asked to decide questions arising from section 51 (xix) of the Constitution, which provides the parliament has power to make laws with respect to “naturalisation and aliens”. The plaintiffs are men born in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, not Australian citizens, who were facing deportation after failing migration character tests as a result of committing violent assaults here. Their lawyers argued the power should be read so as not to apply to a person who is not a citizen of Australia, who is a citizen of a foreign country and is not naturalised as an Australian citizen, but who is an Aboriginal person. The majority judges may as well have said the Constitution’s framers had this limitation or exception in mind but did not write it down.
 
 All seven judges accepted the “tripartite” definition of Aboriginality that had been set out in the Mabo case. This requires that a person be the biological descendant of Aboriginal people who lived in Australia before British settlement, identify as an Aboriginal person and be recognised as an Aboriginal person by the elders or other persons who have traditional authority to do so. Fair enough, but the majority justices have taken the law for a walk. Justice Michelle Gordon pointed out that Australian law already recognises the connection between Aboriginal Australians and Australia’s land and waters, and therefore they cannot be classified as “aliens”. For her, native title was but one legal consequence of the common law’s recognition of the connection; exclusion of Aboriginal Australians from the term “alien” was another. As Professor Twomey observes, this logic leaves open the question of whether a host of other legal consequences will be identified in the future. Wait and see.
 
 Chief Justice Susan Kiefel said it was wrong to apply the connection to land required in native title cases to an “entirely different area of the law”. She said a mechanism by which Aboriginal communities would have the power to determine when normal migration laws will apply “would be to attribute to the group the kind of sovereignty which was implicitly rejected by (the Mabo decision)”. Justice Patrick Keane argued this confused rights of property with citizenship. Aliens can own land in Australia but still need a visa to visit.
 
 The third dissenter, Justice Stephen Gageler, raised practical issues about Australia’s immigration program. He was concerned about relegating people to a “constitutional netherworld” of non-citizens who are non-aliens. It’s illogical and applies only to indigenous people who are citizens of another land. Cutting through in her dissent, however, Chief Justice Kiefel pointed out that it is settled law and up to parliament to create and define the concept of citizenship and determine who is an alien. Otherwise the court is usurping the role of parliament.Invariably the decision brings us to constitutional recognition of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the proposed voice to parliament. Justice Gageler expressed concern no such voice had informed the court in the case at hand given the potential ramifications of this decision. If there is to be “constitutionally mandated differential treatment of some or all, then the Constitution should be amended to produce that result by referendum”, he wrote. Does the court’s judgment create “special rights or privileges” for Aboriginal people and a race-based constitutional distinction? This will be hotly debated and will undeniably inform the fraught politics on the road to a referendum. We support an indigenous voice to parliament and the process by which the Morrison government is refining the question to be put to the people this term. But the dissenting judges have highlighted the possible pitfalls, where the personal values and philosophies of judges, or “creativity” from the bench, hold constitutional sway. Will the Australian public trust a court that is prone to such frolics and the vibe?",797
93,Activist majority’s alien view of judicial power,News,2021-05-16T15:07:31.417Z,"This week’s High Court of Australia case, Love v Commonwealth, on the question of deporting plaintiffs who were born outside Australia, are foreign citizens and who have not been naturalised or made Australian citizens, but who claim to be Aborigines, was in my view a disgrace.
 
 By 4-3 it effectively constitutionalised identity politics; in a weird sort of way it elevates the common law — judge-made law to be clear — above the Constitution itself; it introduces a race-based limit on the parliament’s power; it looks very much to be a clear case of outcome-oriented judging, meaning you start with the conclusion you want and then struggle to find rationales to get you there.
 
 Amusingly, sort of, the case more or less ignores or abandons the established heads of powers interpretive methods — the ones that to my mind have been used by our top court to deliver the most pro-centre federalism case law in the world, but does so out of the blue in this case where no Australian state actually benefits from that abandonment; oh, and given the tools the judges had to work with it is now fair to say that our top judges are vying for the title of the most activist judges in the common law world.
 
 Sounds harsh, I know. But I stand by all of the above claims. Nor am I alone in my worries or condemnation. Take the three dissenting judges. Chief Justice Susan Kiefel attacks the majority reasoning noting that “it is not for this court to determine whether persons having the characteristics of the plaintiffs are aliens. Such an approach would involve matters of values and policy. It would usurp the role of parliament.” “[The plaintiffs’ argument, accepted by the majority, implies that] the common law trumps or controls the Constitution.” Justice Stephen Gageler says the majority’s view is “not legally sustainable”. You can’t use the common law, he notes, to smuggle in notions of “cultural and spiritual connections to the land … to arrive at constitutionally mandated [factors that allow the common law to be transformed] into a constitutional limitation on legislative power”.
 
 And the third dissenter, Justice Patrick Keane, comes out and says what the vast preponderance of Australians believe. “There is no support in the … Constitution for the contention that there is a special class within the people of the Commonwealth who, by virtue of their biological descent … enjoy a constitutionally privileged [position].” The four majority Justices disagree. Justice Virginia Bell is the bluntest and most honest. “The Commonwealth’s concern, that to hold that its legislative power does not extend to treating an Aboriginal Australian as an alien is to identify a race-based limitation on power, is overstated.” Of course, whether constitutionalising identity politics — differential treatment solely on race-based grounds — is here a worry that is overstated is in the eye of the beholder. Nothing Justice Bell goes on to say diminished that worry for me in the slightest or made a remotely convincing case for how it’s an overstated concern. But at least she’s blunt and honest.
 
 The other three majority judgments, by Justices Geoffrey Nettle, Michelle Gordon and James Edelman, indulge in all sorts of politically correct nostrums and observations that sound far more political and activist than legal and constitutional — all basically leveraging or bootstrapping off the common law decision in Mabo to end up with a constitutional outcome that amounts to a just-discovered limit on the elected parliament’s power.
 
 And so Justice Nettle talks of how “different considerations apply … to … a person of Aboriginal descent” and that the Commonwealth’s claims to the contrary “intuitively … appear at odds with the growing recognition of Aboriginal peoples as the original inhabitants of Australia and of their essentially spiritual connection with ‘country’.” Justice Gordon talks of “the deeper truth”, of a “connection [that] is spiritual and metaphysical”, of how this “is fundamentally a question of otherness” and then tells us that judge-made law now recognises “that indigenous peoples can and do possess certain rights and duties that are not possessed by, and cannot be possessed by non-Indigenous peoples of Australia”.
 
 She then tries to rely on the fact that “the Constitution does not prohibit special treatment of a race”, without going on to note that the Constitution’s lack of prohibition is aimed at parliament — not at four unelected top judges remaking the Constitution in their own image.
 
 As for Justice James Edelman, he talks of “essential meaning[s]”, “metaphysical construct[s]”, “powerful personal attachment[s] to land” and then, remarkably I think, says “To treat differences as though they were alike is not equality. It is denial of community. Any tolerant view of community must recognise that community is based on difference.” I couldn’t follow that but he then spends paragraphs pointing out that few people will fall into what is happening here. I’d ­respond: “So what! You are interpreting a Constitution, not deciding case-by-case issues. And this is an activist, horrible precedent.” But let me finish with two key observations. First, those last three judges in the activist majority were all recently appointed by the Coalition. Two by the Abbott government and attorney-general George Brandis. One by the Turnbull government and Attorney-General Christian Porter.
 
 This is astounding. We now have to rely on Labor to give us constitutional conservatives, as they did well with Gageler and Keane. Between now and 2022 three High Court justices retire. Given those last three Lib picks (and see the Brown case if you think this is a constitutional activist one-off — it’s not), do you trust Porter and this government?
 
 Second, I have been a longtime opponent of constitutional recognition. I have always said that any change, any at all, will be used by the judges as an activist tool to deliver politically correct, identity politics outcomes.
 
 Turns out I was wrong; they can do it without any changes to the Constitution at all. Still, this case proves my longstanding point and makes a vote for “recognition” a vote for even more virulent judicial policymaking.James Allan is Garrick professor of law at the University of Queensland.",1052
94,Anthem in Dharug nation-changing,Fairfax,2021-06-15T16:36:35.957Z,"There were tears, relief and pride when the Wallabies belted out the national anthem in language.
 
 The Wallabies performance against the Argentine side on Saturday evening out Parramatta way? It was yet another 16-all victory for the home team, just as we managed against the All Blacks a month ago.
 
 But by Gawd, we had a clear win in the anthems when, for the first time in national history, the first verse of Advance Australia Fair was sung in an Indigenous language at an international fixture. Young Indigenous singer Olivia Fox sang in Dharug, with the Wallabies themselves on backing vocals - after they had had many practice sessions in the previous week to get it right.
 
 For added significance, this took place in what was the heartland of Aboriginal resistance led by the great Indigenous warrior Pemulwuy two centuries ago before he was barbarically shot and beheaded and his head sent to England.
 
 And here, now, at a time when, as a nation, people of good will are trying to inch our way forwards to healing the wound on the national soul - through reconciliation, recognition, the Voice, and a treaty - we had this extraordinary national breakthrough, a seminal, nation-changing moment. As the nation leaned forward, here was an iconic national team boasting an even mix of white and black men about to play a Test match, wearing an Indigenous jersey, singing in two languages and making a wonderful statement: the game has changed, we take our Indigenous past seriously, we are proud of it and from this point forth will be displaying that pride front and centre.
 
 And the reaction has been extraordinary. From all over our brown and pleasant land and, indeed, from around the world, sons and daughters of the Southern Cross reported tears, goose bumps, relief, pride and ... hope that at last we really have turned the corner.
 
 Interested observers were the Kiwis, whose own celebrated tradition in this field began in 1999, before the All Blacks played England at Twickenham, and the Maori singer Hinewehi Mohi gave it her all. It drew a great deal of criticism at the time, but is now all but universally the revered way of singing it.
 
 In Australia, too, despite the outpouring of joy at this way of doing the anthem, there has been criticism, led by Anthony Mundine, who says that no matter what language the anthem is sung in, it remains ""the theme song for the white Australia policy"" and the words must be changed.
 
 ""It's like kicking someone when they're down,"" he went on. ""The message of the anthem is wrong. It was putting salt into the wound for Aboriginal men. You can't just sing the same original text in Aboriginal language and think it's going to fly with people. It got people talking but it still ain't the right message.""
 
 Fellow rugby league star Latrell Mitchell, who is also a proud Indigenous man, broadly agreed: ""When will people understand that changing it to language doesn't change the meaning!""
 
 Despite these comments running against the tide of joy and enthusiasm, you can see where they and the slew of Indigenous activists and academics who agree - Sydney lawyer Teela Reid noting: ""It doesn't change the fact it is a colonial song"" - are coming from.
 
 While the first verse of the anthem that was roughly translated is hardly a theme song for the white Australia policy - apart from the ludicrous line ""for we are young and free"" to encompass the oldest enduring civilisation on earth in an ancient land - there is no doubt the subsequent verse invokes a spirit of this country being no more than a proud outpost of Britain in the south seas.
 
 Other criticism has been that singing the first verse in the Dharug language excludes the other 300 Indigenous language groups and . . . as you can see, despite the breakthrough, there remains some sorting out to do. As a white Australian, my view on which Indigenous language should be used, and when, barely counts, but I might at least note that while both Italy and France were also composed of many different dialects, they sing their national anthem in the languages of the original peoples of Rome and Paris. (I know, I know, the parallel is problematic - but the point remains. While it is wonderful to have made the breakthrough to two languages, taking it up to 300 versions would see the whole thing collapse in on itself.)
 
 Where to from here? Having talked to Rugby Australia chair Hamish McLennan, I am convinced of one thing: the reaction has been so strong and positive this will become a new tradition and it will quickly spread to other sports. To address the issues raised by Mundine, Mitchell et al, the solution, for me, is obvious. The most inclusive and beloved song we have is I Am Australian - the one that is top of the pops for preferred national anthem - and for the next Test it would be really something if the first verse of that could be translated and sung, too.
 
 And then see the goose bumps and the enthusiasm. The whole game is changing and we are getting there!",881
95,Appointment reveals board's tin ear,Fairfax,2021-04-27T06:25:13.215Z,"Comment
 
  Rio Tinto 's decision to appoint an insider based in London as its new leader epitomises a board with a tin ear.
 
 After everything it has gone through, been accused of and apologised for, the appointment of its chief financial officer Jakob Stausholm as the new chief executive raises the question - what has fundamentally changed?
 
 Rio's statement to the ASX announcing the appointment speaks volumes about the company's disconnect with reality. Instead of addressing the elephant in the room, its destruction of the priceless heritage sites at Juukan Gorge due to a culture focused on profit, it played up the new appointee as a numbers man.
 
 It said since joining Rio in 2018 Stausholm had played a leading role in the group's strong performance, ""maintaining capital allocation discipline and delivering significant shareholder returns, while strengthening the balance sheet"".
 
 The need to rebuild Rio's battered reputation was far too subtle.
 
 Stausholm, to his credit, told investors he was ""acutely aware"" of the need to restore trust with traditional owners and other stakeholders. He didn't elaborate on what that actually meant.
 
 Given the CEO's job was up for grabs solely due to the Juukan Gorge disaster, it is disappointing that Rio chairman Simon Thompson didn't make more of it.
 
 Perhaps he was hoping that the soaring iron ore price, the decision by three executives including CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques to fall on their swords and previous apologies was enough and now it was time for the company to move on.
 
 But times are changing and a report released by a parliamentary inquiry earlier this month was a reminder that Rio still has a long way to go to atone.
 
 The parliamentary report said: ""Rio knew the value of what they were destroying but blew it up anyway"". It said the destruction of the sites wasn't a series of ""unfortunate mistakes"" but a decision to put profit above all else.
 
 ""This corporate culture belied Rio Tinto 's public rhetoric of working in partnership with First Nations people, as reflected in the company's (now disendorsed) Reconciliation Action Plan.""
 
 It said Rio should pay compensation to the Indigenous owners of the land, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people.
 
 In light of the report it is surprising that Rio didn't listen to its shareholders who had made it clear they wanted an external appointment as the new chief executive.
 
 Macquarie in a note yesterday said, ""the move to appoint the new chief executive officer from internal ranks was a surprise as we had expected Rio's board to appoint an external candidate from the process"".
 
  Morgan Stanley said, ""given some level of concern in the market related to Rio's past operational issues, we think the market may have been expecting an external appointment"".
 
 ""Some may perceive Mr Stausholm's appointment as potentially indicating little change in overall strategy.""
 
 Indeed, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg must be flabbergasted at the move given his discussion with The Australian Financial Review's Jennifer Hewett in September where he revealed he had called Rio chairman Simon Thompson to tell him the company's next chief executive should be Australian along with the majority of its directors.
 
 ""With the vast majority of its revenue coming from Australia, it is fitting to once again see an Australian as CEO along with the majority of the board. It was a constructive conversation,"" Frydenberg told the AFR.
 
 The ASX statement didn't mention where Stausholm will be based but the company's expectation is it will continue to be at Rio's London headquarters, positioned at 6 James Square, St James.
 
 St James is one of the more wealthy suburbs in London, minutes from Buckingham Palace and The Ritz. One British website describes St James as ""an aristocratic neighbourhood in central London"".
 
 It is far from the dirty blue-collar business of mining and the 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site that it blew up with no regard. The company's growing disconnect from Australia is seen as a key reason why it landed itself in such a deep mess.
 
 This is despite the fact that Australia generates as much as 80 per cent of the group's profits, largely from its iron ore mines in the Pilbara.
 
 Rio's initial reaction to the backlash over its destruction of irreplaceable Aboriginal heritage was arrogant and insensitive. It initiated a flimsy investigation, allowed those directly responsible to step down at their convenience instead of immediately with their pockets full.
 
 It is why investors reacted so badly.
 
 HESTA chief executive Debby Blakey didn't directly comment on the latest appointment but said in a statement that as an investor, the industry fund was closely watching how the Rio Tinto board and its senior leadership take action to improve governance and oversight and respond to the very substantial recommendations of the parliamentary inquiry. She said investors had an expectation of significant and lasting change. ""A vital first step is opening up all agreements with traditional owners to an independent review,"" she said.
 
 ""Like other global investors, HESTA will continue to evaluate the action Rio has taken to address serious concerns about the systemic risk these agreements and how they are negotiated pose to both Rio and other companies in the sector. We will continue to engage on these issues, which will inform our share voting at Rio's AGM in May.""
 
 Australian Super declined to comment, as did the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, but that doesn't mean they aren't watching.
 
 The boards of Australia have managed to get away with flawed governance for too long. Rio's number is up. Any more screw-ups and more heads will roll.",966
96,"As we reflect on Black Lives Matter, justice reinvestment shows there can be a better way",Others,2020-02-07T18:31:58.896Z,"As people continue to march across the US in support of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, Australians must also reflect on the injustices happening every single day here at home.
 
 That includes right here in the ACT.
 
 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are disproportionately represented across the ACT's justice system, and make up too much of our local prison population. This is often compounded by social and economic issues, combined with the effects of intergenerational trauma, disenfranchisement, colonisation and structural racism.
 
 This trend is broadly reflected around Australia, and across much of our justice system. Across the country, while crime rates are going down, incarceration rates are going up. A growing population, together with more awareness around domestic, family and sexual assault, are part of the story. More effective policing, reduced rates of bail, and social issues like unemployment, poverty and family trauma, particularly among young offenders, also have an impact.
 
 As imprisonment rates rise, the challenges of housing growing rates of detainees are only going to increase, and the Greens don't believe we can - in good conscience - maintain the status quo.
 
 Other Australian jurisdictions are responding to this challenge by simply spending millions more building more prisons.
 
 That's where justice reinvestment comes in.
 
 At its heart, justice reinvestment means being honest about the reality of incarceration in Australia. We cannot keep building larger and larger prisons in the hope that this will simply deal with the issue of rising imprisonment rates - or ""solve"" systemic disadvantage. We know we must do things differently if we want a different outcome.
 
 Justice reinvestment seeks to make the ACT a community that arrests vulnerability, not just individuals; one that addresses the causes of offending. It looks to reduce crime and make communities safer by redirecting money away from prisons into stronger, more supportive communities. It believes that prevention and early intervention is better than cure, and that imprisonment usually proves to be a temporary solution to the root causes of criminal behaviour.
 
 The work in the ACT to realise the principles of justice reinvestment for those coming in and out of the prison system marks some of the most ambitious justice work under way in Australia. This is the first time an Australian jurisdiction is reinvesting funds that could otherwise be used to build bigger prisons every five years - instead funding evidence-based programs focused on crime prevention and addressing the actual causes of criminal behaviour.
 
 In the ACT, as part of our Parliamentary Agreement, we have committed to an ambitious target of reducing recidivism (reoffending rates) by 25 per cent by 2025. Meeting this target will be a challenge - to think differently about how we address our use of imprisonment as a punitive measure, and how this can be done in a safe and supportive way for our community.

 ACT justice reinvestment trial extended after strong results Organisers urge social distancing for Friday's Black Lives Matter protest Jenna Price: Stop stealing Aboriginal kids from their families Already, we have fully funded Yarrabi Bamirr - a truly co-designed model of on-the-ground justice reinvestment, in partnership with Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Service, the Aboriginal Legal Service and the Women's Legal Centre ACT. We have also funded new Indigenous Liaison Officers within the Victims of Crime Commission, expanded circle sentencing options for juvenile offenders, and introduced a new model of offering Winnunga's Aboriginal health services as a healthcare provider in the prison.
 
 While community rehabilitation efforts are important steps in the right direction, we cannot stop there.
 
 With the right support in place, including the right cultural supports, we can help change the trajectories of those coming in and out of the prison system.
 
 This kind of approach can also show broader benefits for local communities. In times of challenge, stress and pressure, community resilience is vital to reduce conflict and promote social coherence. Justice reinvestment lends itself to this resilience, by empowering local communities and grassroots agencies with the tools to enact local solutions. Nowhere is this more important than when government seeks to work with local Indigenous communities.
 
 Justice reinvestment gives us hope that there can be a better way. If we are ever to address the unjust overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our jails, we have to do things differently, because what has been done in the past has simply not worked.

97,Australia is not immune from US-style tension,Fairfax,2020-12-14T00:19:19.595Z,"The protests in the US in the wake of the murder in police custody of African American George Floyd have shocked many Australians but they have also started a discussion about parallels between the problems in the US and the plight of Indigenous Australians.
 
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison has deplored the violence in the US but expressed relief that Australia was different. ""We have our problems. We have our faults. We have our issues. There's no doubt about that. But when I see things like that, I'm just very thankful for the wonderful country we live in,"" he said.
 
 The Prime Minister is right to highlight differences of history, ethnic composition and institutions which mean the situation facing African Americans and Indigenous people here is not directly comparable. We do not have the legacy of slavery and we do not have Donald Trump as our national leader.
 
 Yet there should be no illusions that Australia is immune to the tensions that fuelled the riots in the US. The divide between black and white in Australia is, in many ways, just as shocking as in the US but it is less visible because Indigenous people make up a smaller share of our population, and many of the worst problems occur in remote and regional areas far from media scrutiny.
 
 There is one current example - it has emerged that a week ago, mining company Rio Tinto dynamited a rock shelter of high cultural significance in the Juukan Gorge in WA which showed evidence of occupation dating back 46,000 years. Rio Tinto has apologised but failed to provide a clear explanation of why it ignored the concerns expressed by the local Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation.
 
 The destruction of the cave was appalling and raises questions about the commitment of Rio Tinto and the WA government to protecting unique Indigenous sites such as Juukan Gorge. The failure to respect such an important site and be transparent about the processes will require more than an apology to overcome and is just one example of failing our Indigenous community just as badly as the US has failed African Americans.
 
 ""Black lives matter"" protesters in Perth on Monday highlighted the similarities between the high rate of Indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody here and the US. Indigenous people make up 29 per cent of the prison population in Australia compared with 34 per cent for African Americans in the US, but they make up a much smaller percentage of the general population.
 
 Since 1991, 432 Indigenous people have died in custody, many under troubling circumstances. A Northern Territory policeman is soon to go on trial for the murder of 19-year-old Kumanjayi Walker at his home in Yuendumu. A NSW coroner's inquiry last year found failures in training had contributed to the death of Indigenous man David Dungay in custody after he, like Mr Floyd, had complained, ""I can't breathe"".
 
 With that background, we must use events in the US to remind us that Australia still has a very long way to go to heal the wounds of the historical mistreatment of Indigenous people. We must make much faster progress in closing the gap in health and education outcomes and encouraging Indigenous entrepreneurs. The most recent Closing the Gap report in February said one in four Indigenous children in years 5, 7 and 9 remain below the national minimum standard in reading.
 
 The protests here also serve to highlight the argument for creating a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous Voice along the lines of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. If Indigenous people have a body in Canberra where they can express their views on matters that affect them directly, it will provide a far more democratic alternative to taking their anger to the streets in violent protest.

98,Bad name for new airport won't fly,Fairfax,2021-06-12T16:49:01.848Z,"The Quarrymen, the Silver Beetles, wait, no, what about the Beatals? Naming the band is a tricky business. It took John, Paul, George and Ringo a few false starts before they landed it. In the end it didn't matter. Their sound is instantly recognisable.
 
 Naming the band or, in this case, the land has become a strange diversion for the NSW government. Amid a global recession, it is running a competition to name a patch of land near the coming airport in western Sydney.
 
 ""Be part of history,"" goes the pitch, ""by suggesting a name for the first stage of the Western Sydney Aerotropolis Core."" But history might just be the problem.
 
 In the period between European settlement at Port Jackson in 1788 and 1800, 60 different Aboriginal place names for locations around the harbour were entered into First Fleet records. Comparatively few were retained, with approximations such as Bondi, Woollahra and Woolloomooloo some exceptions.
 
 Preference was given to career-furthering names derived from English figures such as Lord Sydney and William Pitt, or homesick appropriations such as Camden, Canterbury or Liverpool.
 
 Across western Sydney, few Aboriginal place names were adopted, barring interpretations such as Toongabbie, Parramatta and Cabramatta.
 
 The way we put a name to places is more than assignations on a map. Names impart meaning.
 
 We've seen this in the confronting global re-examination of colonial artifice. In the recent Looky Looky Here Comes Cooky film, Aboriginal narrator Steven Oliver - of Black Comedy fame - recounts how ""Uncle Jimmy James [Cook] sailed up the north coast, no shame, naming places all the way"".
 
 Nobody is suggesting the push to rename the ""aerotropolis core"" is a statement on broader culture. But the invitation to grant ""a new name for a new place"" sits uneasily against a 40,000-year history of belonging.
 
 The ""Ferry McFerryface"" debacle should have warned the government off the name game. Equally, the large-scale job losses and economic damage afflicting the region it is seeking to christen would seem a far greater priority.
 
 It comes down to an ability to read the room, listen and stay grounded. Nearly 10 years in power can make that challenging for any government, even one delivering on so many fronts.

99,Band of brothers: Aboriginal men and veterans form an unlikely bond in the face of trauma,Fairfax,2020-05-11T14:41:29.548Z,"War and cultural stories cement a special bond, writes Ella Archibald-Binge. Photographs by Rhett Wyman.
 
 On the surface, war veterans and young Indigenous men might seem to have little in common. But psychologist and army veteran Tim White saw a clear connection: ""Both have massive problems with trauma, with post-traumatic stress.""
 
 Living in various remote Aboriginal communities across Cape York in far north Queensland for the past 20 years, White noticed unsettling trends among both groups. For many of his fellow veterans, their world had ""become a lounge chair and a bottle of beer"". Meanwhile, Aboriginal men were being sent to prison at alarming rates.
 
 Three years ago, he brought the two cohorts together in Wujal Wujal, four hours north of Cairns.
 
 ""As a social scientist, I sort of sat back with a notebook and pen and said, this works,"" White says. ""They recognise each other.""
 
 It signalled the beginning of Kapani Warrior, a three-month military training program that aims to help young Indigenous men from across Cape York manage aggression, substance abuse and trauma.
 
 White says the relationship between veterans and recruits is ""symbiotic"". Veterans offer valuable training, connections and mentoring, while the Aboriginal men give an insight into their cultural practices, such as hunting or fishing. Together, they have created a crucial support network.
 
 Kapani graduate Jockton Fourmile said the group had become ""one happy little family"". The 20-year-old from Yarrabah, an hour's drive from Cairns, was unemployed before joining the program last year.
 
 ""I used to be a bit bad on yandi [marijuana] ... but they pulled me away from that,"" he says. ""If [the veterans] see you a bit down, a bit sad and that, they'll boost you back up, make you feel happy, make you feel part of the army family.""
 
 Fourmile has since joined the army's 51st Battalion, Regional Force Surveillance Unit - a Cairns-based squad responsible for border security.
 
 Yearly Indigenous recruitment rates for the unit have been steadily increasing, from about a dozen in 2016 to 94 last year. In total, there are 220 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander soldiers within the battalion.
 
 ""We will claim that every day of the week,"" White said.
 
 An Australian Army spokesperson says the rise has been partly thanks to the Kapani program and a 2017 push to improve relationships with remote Indigenous communities.
 
 Soldiers in the 51st battalion can live in their community, undertake paid part-time work in the army reserve and deploy on border protection operations ""where they can protect country"", the spokesperson says.
 
 Kapani Warrior operates in six communities across Cape York.
 
 White says he regularly received requests to take the program to other Indigenous communities across Queensland and the Northern Territory, but with only a small grant from the federal government to run pre-employment defence training, he ""simply can't respond"".",502
100,Battle against power and glory,Fairfax,2021-12-05T18:56:20.664Z,"Protesters are facing an uphill battle when the institutions of hard power enjoy a high level of esteem.
 
 Consider this - 58 per cent of American registered voters support ""calling in the US military to supplement city police forces"" in addressing the George Floyd protests across America. Only 30 per cent oppose.
 
 That's according to independent polling by Morning Consult.
 
 And it almost doesn't matter how you slice up the data, you still get a majority in support - every level of education, every income, every age group older than 24, men, women, urban, rural, military and non-military households, government and private sector employees, the retired, homemakers.
 
 Even 49 per cent of those who disapprove of Donald Trump's performance as president support US military involvement. So do 48 per cent of Democrat voters.
 
 So while you might have considered Trump's threat this week to mobilise the military against his people to crush these protests something unthinkable, it seems Americans find it very thinkable indeed. They might even find it a good thought.
 
 Perhaps, they're imagining something a little less belligerent than what Trump has in mind. The fact that 37 per cent of African Americans also say they support military involvement suggests that is possible. A good portion of this polling was done before police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters to clear the way for Trump's photo opportunity of holding a Bible in front of a church.
 
 It's possible that might have focused some minds on how hard power can be misused, and changed some views. Even so, it gives you a sense of what those agitating for change are facing.
 
 It's not that they don't have support because they do - 47 per cent, according to that same poll. But so do the police (43 per cent).
 
 And the most pronounced divide here is racial and partisan. If you're white and Republican, you support overwhelmingly the police rather than the protesters, and the reverse if you're black and a Democrat.
 
 Even independents are slightly more likely to support the police.
 
 Clearly, the protesters have a big obstacle to overcome with those they need to persuade. Namely, that the institutions of hard power - including the very ones that make up the ""system"" they want to change - enjoy a high level of esteem.
 
 That's not a passing phase - it's growing. Gallup polling in 2016 - after Ferguson, after Trayvon Martin, after the launch of Black Lives Matter - found the level of Americans' respect for police had ""surged"" to its highest in 50 years. Last year, Gallup found the military was America's most trusted institution. The police came third.
 
 Something similar is true in Australian polling, in which federal and state police have become the top two most-trusted institutions.
 
 This comes as the police themselves are becoming increasingly militarised. That's especially obvious in America, where the Defense Department distributes ""surplus"" military equipment to police. As a result, many of them look like soldiers, having acquired machine guns, night-vision goggles, gas masks, grenade launchers, bayonets, armoured vehicles and aircraft.
 
 In Australia, it is more likely to take the form of police sharing training with the military, but it also includes some weapons. It's far less developed, but the militarisation process is under way.
 
 All that adds up to a militarised public culture. These protests, both local and global, arrive in that context: police enjoy expanding powers and more lethal weapons as well as increasing public veneration. Along with the military, they become almost sanctified in public and political discourse, revered as quasi-sacred figures who represent the highest ideals of the nation.
 
 Scandals might come and go, or even begin to pile up in a moment, but they do no lasting reputational damage because they exist only as exceptions to the overarching rule of their honour and virtue. Their power doesn't need to be justified because it is taken to be self-evidently righteous.
 
 What happens when that creed meets racial minorities whose experiences are not of honour and virtue, but of routine, sometimes fatal abuses of power? Well, this.
 
 These protests are so explosive and divisive because they condemn a structure that is officially sacred. They are not content to let George Floyd be a victim of the isolated conduct of a rogue officer. They insist he is merely the latest victim of the racism and self-justifying violence that is baked into policing.
 
 We face a version of that argument here on the question of Aboriginal deaths in police custody, and which we saw anew this week after a viral video of a Sydney police officer slamming an Indigenous teen face-first to the ground in response to a verbal provocation.
 
 In a sanctified, militarised public culture, these become more than civil rights arguments. They become existential: an attack on the very foundations of society. That is especially so for us in Australia, where Indigenous claims to justice are often seen as an assault on the legitimacy of the country itself.
 
 Probably the most chilling thing about watching that video of George Floyd die - or for that matter, the video of that Indigenous Sydney teen - is the supreme confidence and surety with which the police acted. There's not a moment's hesitation or restraint.
 
 In the Floyd case, even the passage of eight minutes, with time to realise the gravity of the situation, with bystanders pleading for the officer to stop, makes no difference. Nor does the fact of being filmed. There's no sense of shame or even uncontrolled excess. It's all done with a kind of moral lightness. There is only power, violence and a sense of entitlement. It is the conduct of the secure, the unquestioned.
 
 That only underscores the monumental task of these protests: to mount a blasphemous argument and win.

101,Bear of racism too easily roused,Fairfax,2020-05-30T15:39:02.434Z,"If only a masterpiece speech from the likes of Michael Holding could end the need to stress that black lives do matter.
 
 If history travelled in a straight line, Michael Holding would be the last person who needed to say that black lives matter.
 
 During Thursday's television coverage of the England-West Indies Test cricket match at Southampton, in support of the players taking a knee and wearing single black gloves, Holding delivered a four-minute monologue that has been described as an ""unflinching masterpiece"" and ""the finest spell"" seen on an English cricket ground.
 
 Probably all that is needed here are directions to Holding's unscripted speech. ""The dehumanisation of the black race is where it started and people will tell you, 'Oh, that is a long time ago, get over it',"" he said. ""No, you do not get over things like that and society has not gotten over something like that.""
 
 He ranged across recent events in the US, the story of Christ, the black inventor Lewis Howard Latimer blanked out of the history of Edison's lightbulb, and stories from his own childhood. At the end of an interview during the next day's coverage, Holding wept as he recalled his mother's experience of being disowned by her family for marrying a man they considered too dark-skinned.
 
 Michael Holding's passion emerged as much in weariness as anger. If history travelled in a straight line, Holding's West Indian cricket team would have resolved this issue a generation ago. For nearly 20 years, the West Indies were undefeated around the world. In Australia, millions fell in love with the game thanks to those West Indians. Have we ever seen anything as beguiling as the sleek approach of the bowler known as ""Whispering Death""? Has there ever been - can there ever be - a more inspiring sight on a cricket field than Viv Richards?
 
 Australians even cheered for the West Indies against our own, and it wasn't just admiration for their athleticism. They had the most intelligent tactical brains and leaders in Clive Lloyd and Richards. Ruthlessly competitive, they outsmarted everyone. They produced post-career statesmen and leaders and, in Holding, the No. 1 broadcast analyst. They put sport at the leading edge of the battle against racism, just as Sir Frank Worrell's inspirational leadership had done in the early 1960s.
 
 For us Australian kids idolising the West Indians, why would we ask if black lives matter? Are you kidding? They were our heroes and to watch them was to learn from them. We would have traded anything to be Holding. We were aware of their political edge and respected it even when we didn't have the words for it.
 
 Famously, the West Indian cricket flame was lit by a comment from Tony Greig, the South African-born England captain, in 1976, that England would ""make them grovel"". England would not beat the West Indies for another 24 years.
 
 Those West Indians oozed politics, which produced complications that we innocents could observe but never experience. Certainly we could never walk in the shoes of men like Holding and Richards, who continued to suffer from racism while we continued to idolise them as conquerors of the world. The ramifications went on, out of the public eye. West Indian cricket was ruptured when some players chose to tour apartheid South Africa. As Ashley Grey documents in his moving new book The Unforgiven, many of the ""rebels"" never overcame the stigma of having taken money from a pariah country.
 
 Sports makes these two sides visible and dramatic. This month, the National Rugby League and Australian Football League will hold their annual Indigenous rounds. They and other sports restarting after COVID-19 have shown solidarity with the BLM protests.
 
 They can point to their success in showcasing Indigenous players as being a step ahead of society, while also acknowledging the prejudices that follow them. The two sides of Adam Goodes's career, the lash and the backlash, continue to be replicated for those, like league's Latrell Mitchell and Cody Walker, who have worn their political hearts on their sleeves. If history travelled in a straight line, these lessons would, once learnt, stay learnt. But it spirals and circles, its shadows squirming beneath the skin.
 
 On Thursday, Holding was joined by Ebony Rainford-Brent, a 36-year-old cricket international for England who remembered the ""constant drip, drip"" of racism in her career. As with Holding, her words were permeated by weariness. This? Again?
 
 But history's illusion is that dramatic achievements and significant individuals can end the argument. Holding said, ""We need to go back and teach both sides of history and until we do that and educate the entire human race this thing will not stop"".
 
 He knows there is no such thing as educating the entire human race. History never arrives. In a month, the racist bear beneath Australian sports, poked again, will ask why we need an Indigenous round, why don't you get over it, and until they hear the words, ""You never get over it"", they won't get over it either.",871
102,Black players a beacon of hope for kids,Fairfax,2021-07-05T05:27:01.038Z,"As the saying goes,""'if you can't see it, you can't be it"". Growing up as the only Aboriginal kid in a predominantly white school and community, it was on the football field that I first saw people like me dominating and thriving. Those early role models sent a powerful signal of success and empowerment. The message from so many other parts of society seemed to be, you're not welcome here.
 
 While sport has a long way to go, it has championed Black players like me. So with this in mind, the importance of Jamarra Ugle-Hagan getting drafted to the Western Bulldogs with the first pick cannot be underestimated. The Indigenous star, from Framlingham near Warrnambool, will immediately become a role model across the country, a beacon of hope for kids who can't see themselves thriving in their own communities.
 
 Sport is one of the few arenas where minority groups see themselves championed. One of the few places where being Aboriginal comes with a positive preconceived perception is the sporting field. And it's an area where Indigenous people have had an immense impact: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders make up about 3 per cent of the population in Australia but just over 10 per cent of the AFL.
 
 Sport is often called the ""great leveller"", and in Australia there has been no greater leveller than the AFL, AFLW and VFL. The platform it has given to Indigenous and multicultural people to achieve great heights and gain respect has been immense.
 
 As the number of culturally diverse players in the AFL and AFLW increases, we should see resourcing continue to increase around them too. There are a number of unique challenges that come with players from different backgrounds joining the game, ranging from the flat-out racism, gaslighting and disgusting reporting experienced by Adam Goodes, through to a lack of understanding of Ramadan. Players who are dealing with this need to feel supported both by their club and by the competition, and generally speaking they do a good job.
 
 The AFL have been world leaders in this space. In 1995, the AFL introduced Rule 30 (now called Rule 35) to combat racial and religious vilification. While it hasn't eradicated racism, it showed that the competition cared and was willing to do something about it. I wonder if this rule would have been brought in back then had there not been strong Indigenous players who were willing to stand up for their people. And if they hadn't been given the platform and respect that came with being a star footballer, would they have been listened to? Unlikely.
 
 Worldwide, athletes have helped to draw attention to sociopolitical issues, such as US footballer Colin Kaepernick taking a knee for the national anthem. Closer to home, Adam Goodes used his platform to talk about inequality, and Eddie Betts continues to educate rather than rage when he gets vilified. Tayla Harris has become a symbol for women in sport - who doesn't recognise a silhouette of that powerful kick?
 
 At the conclusion of the 2020 AFL draft there was another influx of players from multicultural backgrounds, and for the second time ever, there was an Indigenous player taken with the No.1 pick. It's crucial that our great game continues to represent our communities and champion their stories - and what better way to keep Australia interested in the communities than by telling the stories through the lens of their favourite footballing hero?
 
 As the AFL and AFLW continue to become more diverse it can only mean good things for the game and for society. Sure, there is still a lot of work to be done and processes can definitely get better from the top down. But as more kids at grassroots level see themselves on telly playing in the AFL, the more likely they are to go down to their local sporting club to get involved.
 
 And from a younger age, kids from all different backgrounds and creeds will come together and learn from each other, to become more accepting of other cultures through the prism of sport.

 Midgegooroo, the father of the indigenous resistance leader, Yagan, was executed in Perth on May 21, 1833 for his role in the murder of two settlers, Thomas and John Velvick, in an ambush near what is now Bull Creek.
 
 The Fremantle City Council this week baulked at accepting its administration’s advice to rename historic Kings Square as Midgegooroo Place, instead voting to seek public opinion.
 
 I can’t think of any significant place in WA named after a convicted and executed murderer. But there are plenty carrying the names of soldiers who killed people in the course of warfare.
 
 So this all depends on how you view Midgegooroo’s crimes.
 
 It is said that the victors write history and so the record of incidents between colonists and Aboriginals in the early days of the Swan River settlement usually don’t come from an indigenous point of view.
 
 Contemporary newspaper accounts formed the basis of the History of West Australia, published in 1897, the first attempt at a comprehensive appraisal of the colony’s formative years.
 
 Festering tensions lingered on both sides after Yagan and Midgegooroo were accused of a reprisal killing after an Aboriginal man was shot for stealing potatoes in 1830, just a year after the colonists arrived.
 
 The History of WA records there had initially been quite good relations, but by 1833 Yagan began to emerge as less accepting of the Europeans than many of the locals they first encountered.
 
 “The son of a chief, he was himself a man of strength and power; was the hope of his people, and inspired fear among the whites,” the history recounts.
 
 “Yagan was a unique specimen of native manhood, intelligence, sagacity, and bravery. He was over six feet high, and, one writer says, possessed a dignified bearing.”
 
 Midgegooroo was much shorter, but a prominent bump on his head also made him instantly recognisable around the colony.
 
 “Towards the end of April, two thoughtless and cruel murders by white people lighted the fire of revenge in the indomitable Yagan,” the history states.
 
 “A man from Van Diemen’s Land, employed by Major Nairn, was escorting a cart to the house of Mr Philipps, along the track which had been cut from Fremantle to the Canning River.
 
 “He saw unoffending natives on the way, and turning to his companion, said, ‘Damn the rascals, I’ll show you how we treat them in Van Diemen’s Land.’ Lifting his gun, he fired and shot one, and that without provocation.”
 
 A few nights later, a Fremantle merchant discovered his stores being robbed by three Aboriginals and in the ensuing shooting, another of Midgegooroo’s sons, Domjum, was killed.
 
 The next day, April 30, 1833, three carts from the Philipps’ farm, one of them in which the Tasmanian had been travelling days earlier, were leaving Bull Creek, heading for Canning River.
 
 Midgegooroo and Yagan appeared with 30 warriors, asking questions about the cart which now held the Velvick brothers and had only just departed.
 
 Further down the track, at the spot of the earlier shooting, the Aboriginals attacked, leaving untouched Philipps and his four men in the following two carts, but spearing the Velvicks.
 
 It was definitely a reprisal, but possibly a case of mistaken identity, although there were bad feelings between the Velvicks and some Aboriginals.
 
 Lieutenant Governor Frederick Irwin immediately offered a £30 reward for Yagan and £20 for Midgegooroo “dead or alive.”
 
 On May 16, a search party caught Midgegooroo in the bush near the Helena River, playing with a five-year-old son, apparently oblivious that he was being hunted.
 
 Five days later, after Irwin dismissed calls to banish the old man from the colony, Midgegooroo was hauled from his cell, fastened to the door of the Perth jail and shot by four members of the 63rd Regiment, three times in the head and once in the body.
 
 Within two months, Yagan was killed for the reward in the most cowardly way by a 16-year-old colonist in the Swan Valley.
 
 What the Aboriginals thought of these events was remarkably recorded in a report in the Perth Gazette on September 7, 1833, after two of the remaining leaders, Munday and Migo, met with Irwin to try to stop the killings.
 
 “They proceeded to give the names of all the black men of the tribes in this immediate neighbourhood who had been killed with a description of where they were shot and the persons who had shot them,” the Gazette reported.
 
 “The number amounted to sixteen, killed, and nearly twice as many wounded; indeed it is supposed that few have escaped uninjured.”
 
 Munday and Migo explained that killing people for stealing was against their law.
 
 At most it would be punished by banishment or spearing through the leg.
 
 The clash of cultures evident in those accounts is stark.
 
 So where does this debate end? Would indigenous Australians be better off had the British not arrived?
 
 What was the likely trajectory of Aboriginal society left undisturbed? Frankly we’ll never know.
 
 The French and the Dutch were sniffing around.
 
 Does their colonial experience in the Pacific and Indonesia promote them as better invaders?
 
 Or would the Germans — who were in New Guinea from the 1880s — or the Japanese after 1940 have been preferable? How have the Papuans gone under Indonesian control?
 
 The bottom line for me is this: if we want to come to terms with our past, Midgegooroo Place has merit.
 
 After all, the Barnett government gave us Yagan Square in Perth.
 
 But it would be good if everyone understood the past before a decision was made.",998
104,Cathy Freeman gave us more than gold,Fairfax,2021-09-23T23:27:49.902Z,"It took less than 50 seconds; 49.11 seconds to be exact. That's all it took for Cathy Freeman to run into immortality. 49.11 seconds and 200 years.
 
 I was there in the Sydney Olympic Stadium on that cool evening, September 25 2000. Me and 112,000 others, all crammed in to watch this one slight girl carry the hope of an entire nation.
 
 Yet in that crowd I felt alone. It is hard at moments like that, when we are all supposed to be proudly Australian; it is hard to feel Australian at all.
 
 Because I know what being Australian has meant. For my people it has meant loss and suffering and sadness. Australia was something built on top of us.
 
 On that September night, as others held aloft the Australian flag, as young kids smiled with faces painted with the southern cross, I shrunk a little into my seat.
 
 Was it resentment? Was it anger? No. It was more fragile than that. It was a feeling of being estranged.
 
 I could only wonder what Cathy must have been feeling. Of course she was a supreme athlete; steely focused and dedicated, her mind would have been on one thing: winning.
 
 But I knew Cathy well enough to know what she would have held inside. That there was the same aching in her own soul. The same feeling of being Australian yet knowing the full cost of that allegiance. We had never talked about it. We had no need. It is something we share, Indigenous people: an unspoken bond.
 
 Cathy's family, like my own, had been forced from their land. There were too many who had died too young. Too many others who had been locked up or beaten down.
 
 I had seen her in different parts of the world. Our paths had crossed as we had chased our own dreams.
 
 I was there in Athens in 1997 when she won the World Championship. I shared a victory pizza with Cathy and her small support team and we laughed and talked about how black fellas love country music. She was raised on all the same songs.
 
 Now I was here as she was about to enter the stadium for the most important race of her life. There was so much resting on this. This moment was bigger than sport. This was about history; about healing; about reconciliation.
 
 Washington Post sports columnist Michael Wilbon wrote: ""In less than 50 seconds she had become an Olympic champion, given Aboriginal people unprecedented public triumph, endeared herself to mainstream Australia and catalysed the process to reconcile the two.""
 
 But as much as I wanted to believe in hope, I was troubled that Australia could so easily be absolved of its sins. As if a sporting event, a race, one athlete, was all it would take to cleanse ourselves.
 
 In the grandstand that night, I did not want to forget. I did not want to celebrate. I did not want to reconcile.
 
 I wanted Cathy to run for us. I wanted her to run for our families. I wanted her to run for all of our people who had never had a chance. I wanted her to run for all of those who were still outside looking in.
 
 The race itself was a blur. I have barely any memory of it. Just 400 metres, 49.11 seconds of noise and clicking cameras.
 
 And then it was over and Cathy slumped to the ground.
 
 All those waving Australian flags, all those beaming white faces, and there alone on the track this small black girl who had carried a nation on her shoulders.
 
 As she took her victory lap, she ran with two flags: the Australian flag with its debt to Britain and the red, black and yellow Aboriginal flag that honours the earth and the sun and the people.
 
 And there in that moment I could let go; I could be Australian and stand with other Australians; just for that moment I was not alone because Cathy carried our flags and she ran for us: all of us.
 
 It was too much to expect that one runner and one race could save us; you cannot erase two centuries in 49.11 seconds. Twenty years after that night, Indigenous people remain the most incarcerated and impoverished of all Australians.
 
 But we needed that night. I needed that night. Cathy made us feel like winners. For that night we didn't have to feel alone. And Cathy ran with a silent message for us all. Tattooed on her body where three words: ""'cos I'm free"".

105,Chill wind blows around icons frozen in time,Fairfax,2021-01-20T03:58:26.584Z,"Are any of Sydney's statues candidates for toppling into the harbour like the memorial to Edward Colston in Bristol?
 
 One columnist suggested a statue of Lachlan Macquarie in Hyde Park should be removed by the city council.
 
 Material from the National Museum of Australia said Macquarie was known for ""treating harshly those [Indigenous people] who defied the invasion of their lands, often sending out the military to capture or kill known 'offenders""'.
 
 The council told the Herald: ""The City recognises that Sydney's history, particularly in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, includes events and attitudes that our current policies and initiatives need to redress. By acknowledging our shared past, we are laying the groundwork for a future which embraces all Australians, a future based on mutual respect and shared responsibility for this land.""
 
 There are statues of a wild boar, Matthew Flinders' cat and Queen Victoria's cairn terrier. But not many to Indigenous people of note. Here's a list of some CBD statues and how their historical credentials measure up.
 
 Governor Richard Bourke (governor 1831-37) has a statue outside the State Library. The proclamation of governor Bourke according to the Migration Heritage Centre of NSW implemented the doctrine of terra nullius, reinforcing the notion that the land belonged to no one before the British Crown took possession of it. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land. This changed with the Australian High Court's decision in the Eddie Mabo case in 1992.
 
 Governor Arthur Phillip (first governor of NSW) has statues at the Museum of Sydney and in the Royal Botanic Garden. The Dictionary of Sydney says Phillip's official orders with regard to Aboriginal people were to ""conciliate their affections"", to ""live in amity and kindness with them"", and to punish anyone who should ""wantonly destroy them"" ... Phillip and Bennelong developed a kind of friendship.
 
 Governor Lachlan Macquarie (1810-21) has a statue outside The Mint and elsewhere. His status depends on what you read. The Dictionary of Sydney says Macquarie was concerned about the welfare of the original Indigenous inhabitants. ""He organised a village at Elizabeth Bay for the Sydney tribe and an Aboriginal farm at Georges Head, the Native Institution (a school for Aboriginal children)."" The Australian Dictionary of Biography says orders of merit were bestowed on deserving [Indigenous] chiefs but ""... when the natives showed signs of ungrateful hostility, he organised a military drive to chasten them"".
 
 Captain James Cook. His statue in Hyde Park was graffitied in 2017 with ""change the date"" and ""no pride in genocide"" slogans. Cook's inscription states he ""discovered this territory in 1770"", the issue being that scientists have dated Indigenous history in Australia as going back at least 65,000 years. At the time, then Labor leader Bill Shorten advocated balancing history with additional plaques.
 
 Queen Victoria's statue greets visitors outside the Queen Victoria Building. The Australian National University website says in an article that over time a story took hold that claimed Queen Victoria had given (back) Crown land to Aboriginal people as compensation for their dispossession and in recognition of them as the original owners.",540
106,Closing the gap needs real reform,Fairfax,2021-08-19T13:33:28.064Z,"There is now widespread, in-principle agreement on what Australia needs to do to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. But real change requires more than nice words and minor policy tinkering. It requires enduring structural and constitutional reform to empower Indigenous peoples to take responsibility and leadership in their affairs, in true partnership with government.
 
 To date, governments have not implemented the serious structural and constitutional reform Indigenous people have advocated. We are yet to achieve a First Nations constitutional voice, as proposed by the Uluru Statement in 2017 - though co-design work is under way.
 
 The Productivity Commission's recent Indigenous Evaluation Strategy report correctly observed that, after decades of policy development and implementation in Indigenous affairs, government still understands little about how its measures impact Indigenous communities and how initiatives could be improved. This points to deep systemic problems, and the report agrees a shift towards a partnership approach is needed.
 
 The report calls for a new Office of Indigenous Policy Evaluation and an Indigenous Evaluation Council, which would ""centre Indigenous perspectives"" in evaluation processes, in line with principles of self-determination.
 
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison agreed current approaches were failing. He called for a ""locally led, collaborative"" approach, because ""when Indigenous people have a say in the design of programs, policies and services, the outcomes are better - and lives are changed"".
 
 He is right. This is the same thing the Uluru Statement asked for: it is why Indigenous people asked for a constitutionally guaranteed voice, to ensure Indigenous input into policies made about them.
 
 Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull promised his government would ""do things with Indigenous people, not to them"". Then he rejected the Uluru Statement, dishonestly calling the proposed institution a 'third chamber of Parliament' - instead of collaborating with Indigenous people to design a constitutional amendment and legislative structure all parties could champion.
 
 That work must now be belatedly undertaken, hopefully through the voice co-design process. In leading this endeavour, I hope Morrison has more guts and gumption. It's time for more than nice words.

107,Cook events should carry Indigenous voice,Fairfax,2020-11-24T05:35:51.622Z,"The coronavirus outbreak has quelled, or at least muted, many noisy and divisive debates, not least of all those expected to take place over the commemoration of Captain James Cook's arrival at Australia's east coast 250 years ago. The federal government had planned a series of events, including a $7 million voyage by a replica of the ship HMS Endeavour around Australia, but that was abandoned last month owing to the virus-imposed lockdowns around the country.
 
 This is one cancellation forced by the pandemic about which the The Age has only minimal regrets. A year spent re-enacting the arrival of a British ship armed with cannon that engaged in several skirmishes with Indigenous land owners would inevitably have stirred hostile reactions along the way.
 
 Yesterday, the anniversary of when Cook first set foot on Australian soil at Botany Bay, Prime Minister Scott Morrison sought to address the concerns of Indigenous Australians while also celebrating Cook's significant contribution to modern Australia. Mr Morrison honoured ""the resilience, wisdom, custodianship and stewardship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians"", but also acknowledged ""the extraordinary individual of James Cook, whose passion for science and discovery played such a critical role in Australia's journey to the nation we are today"".
 
 The balance between those two themes has shifted since the bicentenary of the landings was celebrated in 1970. The focus then was exclusively on the man himself and his role in bringing British civilisation to what in 1770 was considered an uninhabited land. Today, no one should deny Cook was a great mariner and his voyages have a crucial role in the history of the West's age of exploration. But these themes have diminished in importance for a post-imperial Australia. The gaping wound of 1770 that needs to be salved this year is the legacy of dispossession of Indigenous people that began 250 years ago. We should focus this commemoration on the drama of the first contact between the English and Australia's original owners. It is a story that was barely told or even understood by white Australia in 1970.
 
 Recent work of historians using sources such as stories handed down to modern Indigenous Australians now allows us to consider events in a very different light. The National Museum of Australia has launched an exhibition it hopes will place an important new focus on that history as it will be titled ""The untold stories of Cook and the first Australians"". The record of misunderstanding, even from the first day, should, if nothing else, give all Australians pause. While Cook assumed his right to enter the country and spread the benefits of Western technology, the local Dharawal people wanted nothing to do with his crew, which they saw as returned spirits of the dead.
 
 The differences of law and philosophy were apparent from the first days. While Cook records show he fired muskets to scare away Indigenous warriors who greeted his boat, he thought nothing of his own transgression in fishing in the Dharawal's traditional waters.
 
 Modern history shows how Cook and his crew were all aware of the ambiguity of their dealings with Indigenous people. Indeed, he met his death in Hawaii nine years later at the hands of Indigenous people there. It is hoped the year ahead, free from the predictable partisan debates on our history, will help build awareness that Indigenous people did not just passively accept Cook's arrival, but tried to understand what was going on and respond in accordance with their culture. Telling this story together can help heal the wounds.",609
108,Curfew must offer plan for those with no choice,Fairfax,2020-09-28T06:20:41.416Z,"Few question the necessity of the move to stage four restrictions in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases, as tough as the coming six weeks (or longer) are likely to be. As with most other measures adopted to slow the spread of the virus, however, the imposition of a curfew and increased enforcement powers associated with the declaration of a state of disaster will have the greatest impacts on the most vulnerable Victorians.
 
 Confronting for most, the announcement of the curfew is likely to have been frightening for some. This includes those who have experienced what it is like to live under curfew and increased police powers, such as those from many refugee backgrounds, or people from some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.
 
 While government has taken unprecedented steps to address homelessness during the pandemic, as well as steps to support those experiencing family violence, these measures can never reach everyone who needs them. This applies to many vulnerable Victorians in multiple contexts - but includes young people who may be living in unsafe environments, and who have managed this risk by avoiding going home.
 
 Young people who spend time in public places and/or shuttle between friends' houses often do so because it is not safe for them to go home. These kids have a home - and the lack of safety may or may not have been reported to authorities - but services or interventions have had little effect. In fact, blunt legal responses may have deterred their families from seeking subsequent help, further fracturing relationships.
 
 With families now compelled to spend even more time together there may be even more reason for a young person to be looking to avoid dad's alcohol-fuelled rage - to stay out, for example, until he has fallen asleep.
 
 Meanwhile, the tensions arising for some in relation to remote learning may serve as another source of conflict between a young person and mum. If this hasn't occurred already, this means that adolescents can start to replay the behaviour they've learnt from dad, even if he is now off the scene. Where mum calls police for help and the young person is removed for some respite via an interim Family Violence Intervention Order, this can result in the contrary situation of the young person being temporarily placed with separated dad - to prevent risk to mum and siblings, undeniably essential, but potentially increasing risk to the young person instead.
 
 Nothing is straightforward amid the increasing stranglehold COVID-19 has on the Victorian community. It deepens existing fault lines, as well as revealing new ones. What can mitigate the harm, however, is recognising a potential issue and having a plan to address it before the response causes more harm.
 
 The lack of any sensible or coherent plan to respond to an outbreak in Melbourne's public housing towers is, arguably, the reason the ""hard lockdown"" is now justifiably subject to an Ombudsman's inquiry - the failure to recognise where people will be vulnerable and to develop an appropriate, compassionate plan ahead of time.
 
 Similarly, Victoria Police and other authorised officers under the Emergency Management Act need to recognise not everyone out after 8pm will be flagrantly flouting the law but may be managing risk to their own or others' safety - and plan accordingly. A response informed by evidence and an awareness of the risks many young people face, rather than a punitive one, will avoid more children from being propelled into contact with the criminal justice system.
 
 Just as Victoria Police were urged to hand out masks, rather than fines, to young people upon masks becoming mandatory in Melbourne, Victoria Police should offer assistance and risk assessment, rather than punishment, to young people out after 8pm.
 
 As the bulk of Victorians disappear further down the rabbit hole of an insular existence, our collective awareness that some people do not have a safe environment in which to weather lockdown diminishes. The vulnerable in the community become less and less visible when we do not go far past our front door.
 
 While the steps adopted to curb COVID-19 are needed, it's vital that government and its enforcement agencies understand it is possible to take strong measures and still support those at risk. Let's hope that, this time, there is a plan.

109,Day of reckoning for the nation,Fairfax,2021-09-26T03:19:17.652Z,"Three generations of one family reflect on what Australia Day means to them now and what it could mean in the future. Ella Archibald-Binge and Rhett Wyman report.
 
 As January 26 approaches each year, Marlee Silva feels the anxiety start to creep in.
 
 ""It's like this kind of amplified hypervigilance,"" she said.
 
 The 24-year-old Kamilaroi and Dunghutti woman is no stranger to being cornered in the office and asked to explain the collective attitude of Indigenous Australians towards one of the most politically charged days of the year.
 
 ""It's not like I don't have the answers ... it's just that you don't want to go through the motions again,"" she said.
 
 ""There's some non-Indigenous people who are asking you about it just to go back at you and try to argue with you, and there's no way that you can fully articulate what it feels like and why it hurts so much.""
 
 The positions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people towards Australia Day are as varied as Indigenous communities themselves. To some, it's Invasion Day. To others, it's Survival Day. Many want to change the date, while some sections of the community want to abolish a national celebration altogether.
 
 Within the Silva family, too, there is a range of views. Marlee, father Rod and grandmother Alice each have a unique perspective on January 26, shaped by their experiences of growing up Aboriginal in Australia.
 
 Marlee got a fresh insight into community attitudes last year when she launched a campaign through her Instagram account, Tiddas 4 Tiddas - a platform empowering Indigenous women - asking people to share their views on the topic.
 
 She was surprised to see a strong response from her non-Indigenous audience: ""That was just this overwhelming and very comforting sense of 'here we are as your allies, hands in the air, we want to do what's best for you, so lead the way', which I've never experienced before in my life.""
 
 And while many wanted a shift away from January 26, others argued to ""not change the date and keep the debate"", in a bid to keep Indigenous issues in the spotlight. The responses prompted a rethink for Marlee, formerly a strong 'change the date' supporter.
 
 The Sydney-based writer was raised in the Sutherland Shire in a ""very white area"". She grew up celebrating Survival Day each year at Yabun Festival, a community event at Victoria Park honouring the ""survival of the world's oldest living culture"".
 
 Marlee didn't see her actions as political until the back end of high school when she began fielding questions from her mostly non-Indigenous classmates after the long weekend.
 
 She recalls her younger sister, Keely, once went to a friend's place the day after Australia Day, with the Aboriginal flag still tattooed on her cheek: ""One of her friends asked her why she had that, [when] it was Australia Day.
 
 ""I was being more and more politicised internally because of the pushback that comes from being Aboriginal in a very high Anglo-Saxon population area, and also being Aboriginal and light-skinned,"" she said. ""Hearing about what [my grandmother] went through and what dad went through growing up, and also facing my own version of [racism] as a teenager, turned into a lot of anger and bitterness that sort of almost felt like it came to a point at every time of the year that we got to January 26.""
 
 Marlee still believes the date of our national celebration should change - ""it's the first point that the trauma started happening"" - but now she says the issue is less about the timing and more about our national identity, or lack thereof.
 
 ""I think part of the problem with the day is not only the history, but when you consider the fact that a lot of migrant groups don't feel comfortable on the day too, it's actually how we present ourselves and our national identity,"" she said. ""So if we're going to move the day, we have to also move our conversation about what it means to be an Australian - not only what it means to be an Australian right now, but what it will mean in the future.""
 
 Two generations ago Marlee's grandmother, Alice Silva, would never have dared voice such an opinion. The 79-year-old grew up on the Aboriginal mission at Moree in northern NSW, at a time when Indigenous people weren't even counted in the census.
 
 Racial segregation was rampant in the town: Aboriginal people weren't allowed to swim in the local pool and were made to sit in a roped-off section at the local cinema, until Charles Perkins' Freedom Ride bus came through town in 1965 and sowed the seeds of change.
 
 ""If we went to the town to buy food and that, they would abuse [us] and tell the shops not to sell anything to us,"" Aunty Alice said. One of 12 children, she was among the first Aboriginal people to attend the local high school, ruffling more than a few feathers when she went on to become the school's first Aboriginal dux.
 
 ""They were very racist at the school ... but I treated them exactly the other way. I said if you want to be stupid all the time, do it,"" she said.
 
 Aunty Alice is believed to be the first Aboriginal social worker to graduate from the University of Sydney, later rising through the ranks in the Department of Community Services and completing further university study - all while raising five children in western Sydney. Now living with Alzheimer's, she doesn't have strong feelings about Australia Day, preferring to reminisce about the struggles of her childhood and how she overcame them.
 
 ""Nan's always been just a hard worker ... prove yourself through your work, rather than protesting or things like that,"" Marlee said. ""It's always been get your education, and that's how we'll prove everyone wrong.""
 
 Others took a different approach, demanding change through activism.
 
 The first Australia Day protest was held on the 150th anniversary of the landing of the First Fleet in 1938, when a group of Aboriginal people gathered at Australia Hall in Sydney and declared January 26 a Day of Mourning, rallying against the ""callous treatment"" of Indigenous people and calling for equal rights.
 
 ""While white men are throwing their hats in the air with joy ... aborigines [sic] will be in mourning for all that they have lost,"" Melbourne newspaper The Argus reported.
 
 But as Marlee's father, former NRL star Rod Silva, points out, speaking out during the era of assimilation policies was a risky business. ""Through my upbringing, it was always frowned upon if there was anyone outspoken,"" he said. ""And the ones that did speak out were always getting attacked by everyone else."" It's something Rod was keenly aware of during his time playing professional rugby league with Easts and Bulldogs in the '80s and '90s.
 
 ""Although I did have strong feelings about Aboriginal stuff, it was best to keep it to myself because of what had happened to my grandparents, my parents, my aunties and uncles,"" he said.
 
 Pointing to Adam Goodes as a recent example, he argues not much has changed: ""I don't know if it's our country or our media or the whole of our society, it's still frowned upon if you're outspoken if you're Aboriginal, in my opinion.""
 
 The 52-year-old grew up in Mount Druitt in Sydney's west as one of five children. His eldest brother died at one. The same year, his father started drinking and ""couldn't get off it"", gambling away much of his salary from his job on the wharves.
 
 ""A lot of other Aboriginal families, they were in the same sort of situation. So we didn't have much, but we had each other and we supported each other,"" Rod said. ""It was tough, but we learnt a lot of good values that I still carry with me today.""
 
 Racism was still rife during his childhood. Rod wasn't allowed into the homes of his non-Indigenous friends. He wasn't invited to sleepovers. Teachers treated him differently. If he was hanging around with a group of mates after dark, only the Aboriginal kids would be interrogated by the police.
 
 ""I didn't understand it. I thought when I was a kid there was something wrong with me because I was a different colour,"" he said.
 
 These experiences motivated him to become a police officer after retiring from professional footy in 2001. ""I wanted to stop being scared. And I wanted to make sure other Aboriginal kids didn't get picked on just because they were Aboriginal.""
 
 He is about to move into the NSW Police Youth and Crime Prevention Command, with the hope of saving disadvantaged Aboriginal kids from choosing the wrong path, like so many of his childhood mates.
 
 Rod says he is finally finding his voice on Aboriginal issues - thanks, in part, to his daughters. ""We love this country and we love our lifestyle, but in recent times I think our society has been more educated because we've had these stronger, young Aboriginal people coming through and giving a more balanced look at what actually happened and why [January 26] is sad for us,"" he said.
 
 ""I think Marlee and Keely have got so much strength from their grandmothers, their great-grandmothers, their aunties - all these strong Aboriginal women, to have a voice. I couldn't be more proud of them.""
 
 Rod remembers the excitement he used to feel on Australia Day when he was younger. He says his view was ""very white, if I could use the term"". Now, while he still believes January 26 is a ""significant day in our history"", he doesn't feel comfortable celebrating ""because so much sadness has come from it"".
 
 To move forward, he wants to see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people recognised in the constitution - ""I'm not a politician, but I think it's a worthwhile discussion"" - and better education around Australian history.
 
 ""When I went to school ... in the curriculum you were taught about Australia Day as the Europeans settled and made our country great,"" he said. ""There was nothing about the Aboriginal history or the culture or everything that was already there ... I would like to see a more balanced approach to education about our country.""
 
 This Australia Day, 250 years after the arrival of Captain Cook, the Silva family will return to Yabun Festival to celebrate everything they, and other First Nations people, have overcome.
 
 Meanwhile, Australians from all backgrounds will join thousands of protesters at the ever-growing Invasion Day rallies across the country.
 
 So is there a path forward to a more inclusive national celebration?
 
 Marlee says yes, but it's a long one.
 
 ""There's so many amazing things about the country we live in, in terms of our natural beauty, in terms of our history that we're a part of - our true history that's over 80,000 years old. I want to celebrate it,"" she said.
 
 ""I will never disregard how awful it's been since the point of invasion for us, but I think that if we can get to a point where there has been this true healing and it has been something that means that this country really does offer equal opportunity for everyone, then it should be something to celebrate.""

110,Drug use not just an inner-city issue,Fairfax,2021-04-16T20:40:45.468Z,"For many of us, the announcement of a second safe injecting centre in Melbourne came more as a relief than a surprise. The North Richmond centre has become one of the busiest in the world, providing services for 4350 people who visited the centre 119,000 times.
 
 This makes it twice as busy as the NSW centre in Kings Cross.
 
 The North Richmond centre has been riding a wave of increased heroin use - evident in Melbourne and around the world.
 
 In Victoria, heroin deaths have increased 225 per cent since 2012. Overdose deaths have outnumbered the road toll in Australia for a number of years.
 
 While the centre has been controversial, much of that, it could be argued, has been media driven. The centre has changed lives and it will continue to do so.
 
 The number of people finding a pathway to therapy continues to grow. Conservatively, in the 18 months the centre has been open, 21 lives have been saved. I know many people do not consider these lives all that worthy, but their families still hold out hope that as long as they are alive, they will come off drugs.
 
 These people form a very particular group within society. Most had overdosed many times before the centre opened; most have been diagnosed with a mental illness; most are experiencing homelessness; and nearly all have experienced childhood trauma. Some 13 per cent are Indigenous.
 
 While I was not surprised that the review recommended a new centre be opened, I was surprised that they didn't recommend more. Twenty years ago, then Labor premier Steve Bracks initiated an expert report that recommended a trial of injecting facilities. The report found the best way to do this was to open five. The ambulance statistics bore that out then and they still do now.
 
 Alas, the Reason Party is not in government. But if it were up to me, I would be looking at conducting a safe injecting trial in such areas as St Kilda, Dandenong, Brimbank and Geelong. If we are relying on statistics, we can't pretend that it's just an ""inner city thing"". It's not.
 
 However, I'm not cracking open the champagne for Premier Daniel Andrews and Mental Health Minister Martin Foley. Good on them for doubling down on an issue that has had its fair share of controversy, but I don't think any of us deserve praise for listening to evidence, consulting experts and acting accordingly. It's solid public health policy. I know that an election year is never a good time to discuss controversial issues. Yet, in cities such as Vancouver, the community deems injecting rooms as crucial to the wellbeing of their city, and to its amenity and reputation. Vancouver (one-quarter the size of Melbourne) has six injecting centres.
 
 Melbourne need not be afraid of the injecting centre, but should see it as an opportunity to help get drug-affected people off the streets.
 
 The review of the Richmond facility reported, cryptically, that a second centre might be run differently. I suspect that means a greater focus on amenity and community engagement.
 
 I have a wish list for the new centre based on what we have learnt in North Richmond, but also what we are learning from overseas.
 
 I want to see hydromorphone as another opioid replacement therapy provided to those who are not responsive to other treatments such as methadone.
 
 We know that while people spend their waking hours meeting the demands of their addiction they can't deal with their mental health and homelessness. This vicious circle means drugs are used to reduce the pain of ill health and homelessness, but also exacerbate ill health and homelessness.
 
 I want to see more rehab beds and I want to them attached to the centre, along with a strong outpatient rehab centre with connections to homelessness and mental health services.
 
 And recognition that while the clients of the centre are the most acute, there are thousands of Victorians at risk of overdose and we could do more for them.

111,Employment numbers don't stack up,Others,2020-12-08T12:42:33.777Z,"I have said this many times before and yet here I am, repeating myself: numbers are a fickle thing.
 
 Without context, without qualitative understanding, without engagement and consideration, they honestly mean very little.
 
 Early last year, the Education and Employment References Committee released a report as a result of the Senate inquiry into the efficacy of the Jobactive program, the program intended to help employers and employees find work.
 
 The committee identified four key issues.
 
 Firstly, the services and support arrangements that should be in place are just not there. Barriers to employment go unaddressed in job-readiness assessments. Caseloads of 150 participants don't allow the time required to deliver these services effectively.
 
 Secondly, the mutual obligations and job search requirements established by the government are often poorly designed and inappropriate. I was stunned to discover that there is no workers' compensation if a Work for the Dole participant is injured during the program. There also just aren't enough jobs out there to warrant monthly ""KPIs"" of 20 applications a month in many areas, so employers are burdened with inappropriate and poor quality applications.
 
 Thirdly, Jobactive's compliance framework is punitive and its administration by Jobactive providers instead of public servants is concerning - especially given that the 2015-16 administrative error rate for penalties was around 50 per cent. Almost 20 per cent of participants in the penalty zone are homeless, and 28 per cent in this zone are Indigenous, despite Indigenous people only representing 13 per cent of Jobactive participants.
 
 Finally, the funding model is driven to incentivise Jobactive providers to ""churn people through short-term work, rather than helping them to secure sustainable longer-term employment"". This is certainly evidenced by the number of degree and TAFE-qualified participants who are told to get a forklift licence or are informed they need to take delivery driving casual work. In fact, 53.9 per cent of employed Jobactive participants are casually employed, and 47 per cent are underemployed.
 
 The government's response to the Senate committee report was as underwhelming as it was unsurprising. It used numbers to back up its unwillingness to accept the premise of the report, stating that the Jobactive system had achieved 1.6 million jobs between 2015 and 2020.
 
 Here's where the numbers don't stack up.
 
 Almost 60 per cent of those job placements did not last longer than six months. For those in Work for the Dole, three months after exiting the program, almost 80 per cent were still not employed. How exactly do these numbers paint a picture of success?
 
 Nowhere in the government's response does it mention any kind of plan to address upskilling for employment consultants, or the need for educational responsibility to deliver these ""enhanced"" services.
 
 The government's response to this crisis is to pull back even further to a largely digital approach. If providers aren't teaching clients about applicant tracking software, or providing them with quality resumes and cover letters now, how is this going to change moving into a digital model of delivery? People will become more disconnected, more disengaged, and reduced even further to not just a number, but a piece of binary code in a database.

112,Ensuring protesters tread a safe path,Fairfax,2021-05-07T13:58:41.909Z,"Many Victorians intend to take to the streets on Saturday in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. It is a cause that resonates well beyond the borders of America. But in the time of a pandemic, a mass gathering of protesters does present a unique challenge to our customary freedoms of expression. There was a fundamental principle that drove Australia's response to the pandemic: saving lives should sit above all other concerns. There was little argument to the contrary. Protecting life is a principle that underpins many of our public institutions and civil society. Victorians should support Black Lives Matter - 432 Indigenous Australians have died in custody since 1991.
 
 Public protest plays an important part in the workings of a democratic society. It must have its limits, as all public discourse does in relation to the discrimination of certain groups and the use of violence, but otherwise the ability to take to the streets, in whatever form, must normally be fully supported.
 
 But these are not normal times, and those wishing to gather face an unusual moral dilemma. While there is limited community transmission of COVID-19 in Victoria, large crowds could facilitate the transmission of the virus, putting their own lives and possibly others they come into contact with at risk. The potential dangers should not be taken lightly.
 
 Premier Daniel Andrews has made it clear he does not want the demonstration to go ahead, but handballed the final decision to Victoria Police. They have opted to give it the green light, and taken a conciliatory approach by proposing not to issue fines or enforce a curfew. They also appear to accept the reality that people would probably still gather even if it was prohibited, and that could increase the possibility of violence between the police and protesters, something that may still eventuate.
 
 Giving authority over the rally to police is a strange call from a Premier who has not baulked at taking responsibility for shutting down all other forms of public gatherings based on medical advice. Victoria's Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, is also telling people not to go, urging them to consider other ways to show their support for the movement. What has now changed to find both of them taking a backseat, giving police the final say? There has been little real explanation from Mr Andrews.
 
 The Age has a long history of supporting the right of people to express themselves freely in peaceful protest. Black Lives Matter should be of the highest public concern and deserves that support. The issues around Indigenous Australians' health and welfare, life expectancy, incarceration rates and deaths in custody are shocking. But we also share the concerns of Mr Andrews and others that it could potentially undermine the hard-won gains Victoria has made in combating COVID-19.
 
 In recent times, public protests have taken new forms to fit the times. In Israel, thousands of protesters gathered in perfect geometric patterns in Tel Aviv's central square to comply with social distancing rules. In Brazil, millions took to their verandas banging pots and pans to express their anger at President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of the pandemic.
 
 Melbourne's rally organisers need to take heed. Black Lives Matter is a just cause that must be heard. But it needs to be done in a way that does not threaten the lives of the very people it supports, let alone others who may not even be involved.",587
113,First Peoples sing with one voice - at last the NRL hears,Fairfax,2021-05-24T21:37:04.257Z,"The Australian national anthem has long been a matter of contention among First Peoples in Australia. It's a song that we're indoctrinated to sing when we're at school, without an opportunity to discuss the nature of the song, or its meaning. It is, however, one that carries weight and is a matter for discussion in many Koori homes, and the homes of other First Peoples around the continent.
 
 Increasingly, First Peoples have become emboldened to take their private feelings into the public arena, where they no longer feel as though they are a lone voice. That shared voice is now reaching the public, and it is very clear: Advance Australia Fair does not represent the First Peoples community.
 
 On Thursday the National Rugby League decided to drop the anthem from pre-match festivities at the 2020 NRL All Stars game between its Australian Indigenous and Maori teams. The decision followed advice from Indigenous players including Cody Walker and Latrell Mitchell.
 
 So let's take a look at the song, its history and why it has come to this. Written in 1879 with designs on representing the dream of a white Australia, its original lyrics were a flourish of patriotic fervour. However, it was a decidedly British fervour that was being celebrated. Consider verse two of the original:
 
 When gallant Cook from Albion sailed/To trace wide oceans o'er/True British courage bore him on/Til he landed on our shore/Then here he raised Old England's flag/The standard of the brave/""With all her faults we love her still""/""Britannia rules the wave.""/In joyful strains then let us sing/Advance Australia fair.
 
 This verse was dropped at Federation in 1901 when a less British-oriented version was adopted. These changes reflected the views of the times.
 
 The lyrics, however, continued to celebrate an Australia that never existed. The song was a vehicle for furthering the myth of an Australia that had been built by ""white"" people. Melanesian and Murri slave labour in the cane fields, cattle and sheep empires built on the exploitation of First Peoples, the stories of African convicts and dock workers, and the gold rushes sustained by Chinese market gardens were all conveniently forgotten, although all were still current or within living memory.
 
 Advance Australia Fair continues to be a window into the past, rather than a reflection of who we are. The ""fair"" in the song has never been about a ""fair go"". It refers specifically to the maintenance of Australia as the land of the white man. There are no references to the ancient history of this land, or the people who maintain the oldest continuous living cultures on Earth.
 
 It's often said that sport and politics shouldn't mix, but it's unavoidable. We need to express ourselves in all parts of our lives, not only those that others are comfortable with. It's always been like that - from the days of Rome's gladiators and senators, through the deeds of Jesse Owens in the face of Adolf Hitler, Jack Johnson versus The Great White Hope, or Sir Doug Nicholls at Collingwood following on from Pompey Austin in breaking the colour barrier in Australian Rules, and George Green in rugby league.
 
 Sport offers the voiceless an arena for expressing their views. For Koori and Murri footballers, or the First Peoples community at large, we don't have regular access to wide-reaching media. Football is our one means of gaining a wide reach in any matter that doesn't paint us in an entirely negative light.
 
 Being the first to speak out can be hard. The NRL's Koori and Murri football players know this. They are aware that they have nothing to gain and everything to lose in going against the beliefs of mainstream Australia. Their pay cheques exist due to some of the audiences they are challenging. The likes of Cody Walker and Latrell Mitchell know they are courting a backlash. They also understand the importance of what they have chosen to stand for.
 
 The NRL All Star game is a celebration of Indigenous cultures and the contribution that their communities have made to the game's successes. The NRL has made a bold and culturally competent call, to support its players in their beliefs, and it is clear many fans support that decision.
 
 With the vacuum created by the removal of the anthem from the All Star festivities we are left with an opportunity. Can we find a common reference point that Australians can unite behind? Could that be the co-authored re-imagining of the anthem penned by Judith Durham and Kutcha Edwards? The lyrics have changed before, and for a song that has only been our official anthem since 1974, perhaps this might be the right time to update it.
 
 Some will say the First Peoples have much more pressing concerns than a song. The incarceration rates of our people, the persecution by police, treaty, self-empowerment, education, land rights, our community's health, mainstream media selecting and promoting voices they agree with while telling us they are our leaders. There are many significant matters. This is another for the list, and one that should not be diminished for the preferences held by some non-Indigenous people.
 
 Our sportspeople should be applauded for speaking out on what they see as injustices. Otherwise, these important concerns will not be heard at all.

114,FOOLISH RULING WIDENS INDIGENOUS GAP INTO A CHASM,News,2020-07-06T15:51:19.621Z,"The High Court has just made things so much worse for Aboriginal Australians Whatever its intentions, the High Court’s decision in Love and Thoms does indigenous Australians no favours.
 
 At a time when the issues associated with constitutional recognition are intensely controversial, it has added fuel to the fire. That it protects two convicted criminals from deportation has only increased the concerns expressed since the decision was handed down on February 11.
 
 To say that is not to deny that the court was fully entitled to consider whether the plaintiffs were indeed aliens for the purposes of section 51 (xix) of the Constitution (which provides that parliament has a power to make laws with respect to “naturalisation and aliens”) and hence subject to the deportation provisions of the Migra­tion Act.
 
 In effect, as then chief justice Harry Gibbs put it some years ago, “the parliament cannot, simply by giving its own definition of ‘alien’, expand the power under s51 (xix) to include persons who could not possibly answer the description of ‘aliens’ in the ordinary understanding of the word”.
 
 A law that purported to define as aliens all of this column’s readers would, for example, plainly exceed the power s51 (xix) confers on parliament, and hence could quite properly be subject to constitutional review. But the fact the court acted within its remit hardly quells the disquiet about its decision. To begin with, the majority — justices Virginia Bell, Michelle Gordon, Geoffrey Nettle and James Edelman — rejected, with little reasoned explanation, the High Court’s previous definitions of the term “alien”.
 
 At the heart of those definitions was the notion that “alien” is broadly synonymous with “non-citizen”. The test that approach provided was objective, predictable and clearly consistent with the term’s ordinary usage.
 
 But the majority swept that test aside, declaring, in Gordon’s words, that whether a person is an alien “is fundamentally a question of otherness”, where “otherness” mainly involves not being connected to this country.
 
 Given its new definition, the majority asserted that indigenous Australians do not merely have what Nettle described as an “essentially spiritual connection with ‘country’” but also “a responsibility to live in the tracks of ancestral spirits”, creating, Gordon wrote, a “two-way connectedness older and deeper than the Constitution”.
 
 From that, it follows — according to Edelman — that “the sense of identity that ties Aboriginal people to Australia is an ­underlying fundamental truth that cannot be deemed not to exist by legislation”.
 
 Indigenous Australians therefore cannot be aliens, which means that any non-citizens who are (however partially) of indigenous descent, identify as indigenous and are recognised as such by the elders of an indigenous community cannot be deported, regardless of the crimes they may have ­committed.
 
 The result is not merely a test that is inherently subjective, unpredictable in its application and ill-defined; it is also an erosion of national sovereignty.
 
 Since at least the 17th century, the right to determine the terms on which non-citizens can access the national territory has been considered an integral component of each country’s sovereignty. To curtail that right, Chief Justice Susan Kiefel writes in her dissent, is “to deny a power which is fundamental to the structure of the Constitution and the governance of Australia”.
 
 By instead allocating that right to Aboriginal communities, Justice Patrick Keane notes, the decision “attributes to those persons a measure of political sovereignty”, starkly contradicting the fact that such “a claim to sovereignty has been rejected (by the High Court) on the few occasions on which it has been articulated”.
 
 The majority have, in other words, recognised those commun­ities — which Justice Stephen Gageler describes as “a non-constitutional non-representative non-legally accountable sub-national group” — as separate political entities that have their own power to determine who is entitled to live on Australia’s national territory. And while the ability to confer an unconditional right of residence is a privilege whose value creates strong incentives for malfeasance, they have imposed no constraints whatsoever on how that power is exercised.
 
 As for the “non-citizen non-aliens” to whom the elders award that privilege, they will exist in what Gageler terms a “constitutional netherworld”, where their legal status — and their scope to leave and re-enter Australia, work or receive benefits — is nebulous, as are their obligations to the Australian state.
 
 The worst of it, however, is that the majority’s reasoning reverses the High Court’s longstanding position that, as then justice Mary Gaudron put it, “race is simply irrelevant to the question of continued membership of the Australian body politic”.
 
 Instead, writes Keane, this decision determines, without any “support in the text or structure of the Constitution”, that there is “a special class within the people of the commonwealth who, by virtue of biological descent and self-identification as members of a particular racial group, enjoy a constitutionally privileged political relationship with the Australian body politic”.
 
 Edelman mistakenly claims that the racial discrimination this decision reintroduces into s51 (xix) simply recognises that “to treat differences as though they were alike is not equality”.
 
 In reality, as Hannah Arendt explained decades ago, it is the very essence of political equality to abstract “as far as possible from those natural and always present differences” that are “merely ­biologically given”, treating black and white, man and woman, the clever and the stupid, alike, notwithstanding salient differences between them.
 
 And far from “closing the gap” between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, inscribing into the section a new distinction based on race can only ensure that gap cements into a chasm. Rather than more such distinctions, the most effective way of drawing a line on past injustices would be to erase all racial references from Australia’s Constitution.
 
 It would be wrong to dismiss those concerns on the basis that the decision’s practical impacts are likely to be limited. As Gageler emphasises, previous findings suggest that the number of people in and around the Torres Strait “who have familial connections with indigenous societies or communities,” and who could therefore be entitled to claim residence, “would not be trivial”.
 
 Moreover, the decision’s definition of “alien” invites reconsideration of all the cases that found that mere connection to Australia does not confer a right of continued residence.
 
 But even if few people were directly affected, a Constitution whose integrity is tarnished by small cuts is tarnished nonetheless, eroding its legitimacy.
 
 It may be that the High Court will reverse itself, as it did in 2003 when it concluded that it had previously erred in finding that some British subjects could not be aliens. It would, however, be foolish to rely on that, just as it would be foolish to assume that it will readily endorse a legislative fix.But simply letting this decision stand, and the damage it imposes with it, would be the most foolish mistake of all.",1165

116,Here's why Black Lives Matter resonates,Others,2021-09-27T18:06:38.169Z,"Trying to make sense of the protests and unrest following the killing of George Floyd, Democratic nominee and former United States Vice President Joe Biden said ""the original sin of this country [the United States] still stains our nation today"". He added: ""We are a country of open wounds.""
 
 He was referring to slavery.
 
 It is a clumsy metaphor - man's fall from grace with God is hardly the same as the state-sanctioned oppression which characterises that country's black history. Nevertheless, there is power in the message.
 
 His meaning is clear - the Black Lives Matter protests, which are still ongoing, are not just about police violence against black people. The rage is rooted in that country's slave past, which institutionalised black disadvantage and white privilege and legitimised the sub-human treatment of black people, like what happened to George Floyd, 150 years since emancipation.
 
 When the most recent protests here first began, some were surprised, even irate, that Australia was importing a movement from the United States. We are the most successful multicultural country in the world, it was said, the implication being that we have no racial issues here. What possible relevance did the treatment of African Americans have to Australia, and why did the movement spread across the globe?
 
 When you peel back history, you find each nation's original sin: racism, in one form or another. Like original sin, it is inherited, a perpetual stain on the conscience, an open wound, in Biden's words, festering in the darkness of ignorance, hate and apathy.
 
 Australia's original sin is a hundred or so years younger than that of the United States, but no less tragic. It lies at the heart of how this nation came to be, a land taken by force from our First Nations peoples, without treaty or compensation, generations stripped of land and connection, relegated to the margins from which the pleas for recognition have repeatedly been ignored.
 
 That is why Black Lives Matter is not just about black incarceration and police violence. It goes to the heart of each country's failure to acknowledge and address their own original sin. That is also why the movement has resonated so powerfully outside the United States.
 
 Black Lives Matter also speaks to a more profound connection between Indigenous Australians, African Americans, Asians and other minorities. One has to be black or coloured to feel it. It's about bonds that unite all coloured people, something innate, not taught. The knowledge that the oppression of one is the oppression of all.
 
 When we are prepared to confront our past, we can start to empathise with those who reject symbols of those who oppressed them. Taking down statues of those who profited from oppression is not about rewriting history, it is about choosing not to celebrate their oppression, to pretend they are more righteous than they are. In any case, history is not fixed in time, it is fluid. The terrorists of yesterday (think Mandela) are the idols of today. Our view of history needs to change with the times in which we live, as we confront more about our past.
 
 The implication of Biden's message is that there can be no healing unless we acknowledge our original sin. Any theologian will tell you, redemption is only possible through forgiveness. Like someone with an addiction acknowledging they need help, first you have to admit there is a problem.

117,How to cut Indigenous prison rates - fast,Fairfax,2020-03-03T02:49:37.740Z,"First Nations Australians are the most imprisoned people in the world. Justice targets for closing the gap were set down for the first time last week, providing a federal measure for reducing the Indigenous imprisonment rate. Yet the new target - to reduce it by just 15 per cent by 2031 - is hugely unambitious.
 
 This nation can do much better. Evidence of that comes this week from Australia's biggest state, NSW, where prisoner numbers - both Indigenous and non-Indigenous - have suddenly and radically fallen this year. Sadly, it has taken COVID-19 to achieve this. Nevertheless, it shows what can be achieved when there is a will.
 
 First, let's recap Australia's woeful position on Indigenous incarceration: it has doubled to 28 per cent of Australia's prison population since the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, yet First Nations people account for only 3.3 per cent of Australians; in NSW, almost a third of all people in prisons are Indigenous; in the Northern Territory it rises to 84 per cent.
 
 But there is hope. Prison statistics for the last quarter, released this week by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, show a 10.7 per cent decrease in the overall prison population and an 11.3 per cent fall in Aboriginal people in prison. Seventy per cent of that decrease is attributed to a decline in the remand population - people denied bail while awaiting trial or sentence. This is because police have been issuing fewer court attendance notices and police and courts are more likely to grant bail. In April, the number of remandees released on bail doubled. There has also been a 27 per cent fall in Aboriginal youth in detention.
 
 The risk of COVID-19 in jails is great, especially if they are overcrowded, and authorities in NSW have acted accordingly.
 
 Coronavirus is indeed an immediate reason to cut prison rates. In US prisons, COVID-19 infection rates are five times the community rate. Death rates are three times and African-Americans account for 48 per cent of COVID-related prison deaths.
 
 In Australia, the risks are heightened for First Nations people due to over-representation in prisons, chronic conditions that are co-morbidities for COVID, and systemic racism in health care. The NSW Supreme Court, in the case of Rakielbakhour v DPP this year, recognised that prisons are susceptible to the spread of COVID, that people in prisons are adversely impacted by onerous restrictions and that Aboriginal people are especially vulnerable.
 
 A survey of people in NSW prisons and their families, by Deadly Connections Community and Justice Services Ltd, found COVID restrictions on visits and programs and prison lockdowns were having a deleterious effect on First Nations people's mental health.
 
 But now NSW prison numbers are the lowest since 2016 - and they are consistent with declines in Victoria. And while the fall has been rapid, it has come without a noted impact of community safety.
 
 Yet tougher bail laws in recent years had swollen the remand population to a third of people in prisons, driven by a risk-averse, tough-on-crime mentality.
 
 In March, the NSW government introduced emergency measures to empower the Corrections Commissioner to release vulnerable people from prisons in response to the threat of COVID-19. But these laws have not been activated. With a COVID outbreak at NSW's Parklea prison and dozens of cases in Victorian youth detention centres, there is urgent need for releases as a precautionary measure.
 
 Any improvements in NSW fall short of the calls of First Nations families and legal services for the immediate release of First Nations people to prevent COVID-19-related black deaths in custody. And there needs to be a long-term government commitment to ""decarceration"", regardless of COVID.
 
 But COVID is an opportunity to reflect on how reducing the prison population can happen in a short time frame - when there is a spirit of protecting lives rather than punishing the marginalised.

 P at Turner has long been a force in Indigenous affairs. A straight shooter, she took aim this week at the government's ""co-design process"" for an Indigenous Voice to Parliament - on which she is an adviser.
 
 Who is she?
 
 Turner has dedicated her life to improving the lives of First Nations people. Born to an Arrernte father and Gudanji mother, she grew up in Alice Springs. The 68-year-old says she was inspired by uncle and mentor Charles Perkins - a ""fearless leader"" who ""said what needed to be said"" - to fight for self-determination for Indigenous people.
 
 Her career spans decades in the public service, including a four-year stint as chief executive of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) from 1994 to 1998. In 2016 she was appointed to her current role as head of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO).
 
 More recently, Turner - who has just been included in the Australian Financial Review Magazine's 10 most culturally powerful Australians - has been a force in negotiating a new framework for the Closing the Gap strategy as convener of the Coalition of Peaks, an alliance of more than 50 Indigenous peak bodies.
 
 In July, she stood beside Prime Minister Scott Morrison to unveil a new Closing the Gap agreement. It was heralded as ""a real turning point in Indigenous affairs"", whereby governments would work in partnership with First Nations people.
 
 What happened
 
 this week?
 
 Delivering a blistering speech for the annual ""Australia and The World"" lecture, she labelled the government's Voice co-design a ""disjointed, conflicted and thus counter-productive"" process that was likely to cause divisions between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
 
 ""What is now unfolding is a convoluted and flawed process,"" she said. ""It is high on rhetoric and well rehearsed: co-design, empowerment, doing things with us, rather than to us. But if we look closely, the practice continues to be poles apart.""
 
 Turner traced the fight for Indigenous self-determination from first contact to the present, noting anything resembling a Voice has been dismantled the moment it becomes uncomfortable for the government.
 
 She pointed to the Closing the Gap agreement as an example of ""shared decision-making"" between governments and Indigenous people, but said the Voice co-design was not following that process - relying instead on hand-picked groups to advise on, rather than help negotiate, options on what a Voice might look like. She said the commitment to shared decision-making was ""not to be applied only at the discretion of governments"". Turner surmised that the Voice proposal was ""doomed to fail"" unless these issues were urgently rectified.
 
 Why is it important?First Nations people in Australia have long sought to have a meaningful Voice in their own affairs. As Turner notes, other liberal democratic nations such as Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and Finland have better-developed institutions and structures for Indigenous peoples to be heard.
 
 After centuries of struggle, the landmark Uluru Statement from the Heart put forward three reforms in 2017 to ""empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country"". At the top of the list was a First Nations Voice enshrined in the constitution.
 
 Supporters of the Uluru Statement say a constitutionally enshrined voice is an integral step in eliminating Indigenous disadvantage, by ensuring First Nations people have a say in shaping the laws that affect them.
 
 The proposal was rejected by the Turnbull government. Last year Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt embarked on a ""co-design"" process for a voice to government, rather than Parliament, which would not be enshrined in the constitution.
 
 When asked this week whether she would accept any model that falls short of the proposal in the Uluru Statement, Turner's reply was ""no"".
 
 Wyatt established three advisory groups as part of the design process. Turner is a respected and prominent member of the senior advisory group. Her comments will likely cast a shadow over the Voice co-design process at a crucial moment. This is the first time she has made her concerns public.
 
 In response, Marcia Langton, the joint leader of the senior advisory group, said it appeared Turner had misunderstood the process for creating the Voice, and claimed the partnership with the government was working well.
 
 Wyatt has defended the process, saying any body set up to advise the government cannot be developed independently of the government.
 
 What happens next?Options for how the Voice should be structured and operate are on the verge of being delivered to the government. The cabinet will decide which of them will be put to the community for feedback, likely later this year. Turner says she will continue in her role on the senior advisory group, noting ""it's better to be inside the tent, making the argument"".",835
119,"If you want to put children first, register social workers",Others,2020-10-04T11:48:42.590Z,"Last week was National Child Protection Week, with the theme ""Putting Children First"". Child protection is incredibly complex work, and involves some of the most vulnerable children and families in society.
 
 Beyond sharing a social media post or holding a morning tea, the week gave us good reason to seriously pause, deliberate, articulate and legislate ways to improve the lives of children, and to ensure child abuse, poverty and neglect aren't ignored.
 
 Recently in South Australia and Queensland there has been media coverage of multiple cases of death and harm being caused to children, including the avoidable cases of a four-year-old girl with Down syndrome and two baby sisters. These stories has been compounded by growing concerns around child poverty, illustrated recently by two autistic brothers found living in absolute neglect.
 
 I want to raise the issue of better and smarter regulation of social workers.
 
 In the wake of the damning 2016 coronial findings on the death of Chloe Valentine, there was suggestion of a national registration system for social workers. This would be a significant public safety measure that would reduce risk and ensure education, practice, and professional standards.
 
 Still to this day, social workers are currently not registered as practitioners in Australia. Rather, social workers are unregistered practitioners and excluded from the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme. The Australian Association of Social Workers has a non-compulsory program, but it has seen limited uptake.
 
 This means technically anyone can call themselves a social worker, since there is no statutory body that regulates the profession. Malpractice, unethical treatment, and gaps can emerge - seen recently in concerns around conversion therapy and the criminalising of the practice in the ACT.
 
 Coronial and government reports continue to identify failures in the child protection system, including the over-representation of Indigenous children, and they continue to call for this national statutory registration of social workers.
 
 I believe that to ""put children first"", we need a strong, well-trained, and regulated workforce to be prepared for the current and future complexity of child protection, poverty and neglect.
 
 An overhaul of a broken system must mean better regulation and innovation. National statutory registration would reduce the risks to vulnerable people by assuring standards in child protection - as well as disability, domestic violence, mental health, drug and alcohol and crisis work. It would also provide greater assurance to workers in the sector who often do not feel supported to make difficult decisions.
 
 Don't we expect teachers, nurses, doctors and psychologists to have the relevant training and registration with them? Would we let just anyone teach, treat or provide counselling to our children?
 
 National registration would mean the federal government could ensure there is a consistent framework and appropriate training, which will create a pool of professionals employers and the public can trust to meet the needs of vulnerable children and their families. It will not, as some report, take away choice; it would aim to make the choice safe. It would allow an employer or client to find a social worker that best matches their needs, while reducing risk.
 
 Child protection workers and social workers alike continue to feel unsupported in their roles professionally, and public confidence in social work needs improvement. Given delays in registration, there has been no strong foundation for the profession to build that public confidence in its ability to manage the complex and wicked problem of child protection.
 
 There also needs to be a strong training and educational foundation for the profession to move into the future, especially post-COVID-19. Recently, social work university courses were at risk of being part of the biggest higher education reforms in decades, with courses set to have fees double. Social work and human services education needs to be supported and funded, and social work academic staff need to be offered ongoing and secure employment.
 
 This will ensure a strong foundation for child protection, locking in training for aspiring social workers and bringing a vibrant social service sector into the future.
 
 It will ensure children are put first.

120,Indigenous ready to take initiatives to close the gap,News,2020-09-29T20:54:06.337Z,"Poverty and economic disengagement are bars to progress
 
  Warren Mundine is correct when he argues that economic fundamentals — jobs, creating the right environment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander entrepreneurship, education and training — need to be the backbone of indigenous policy. In an essay published by the Centre for Independent Studies­ on Wednesday, Mr Mundine, the former head of the Abbott government’s indigenous advisory council and a former Labor Party president, points out that poverty is “the reason for the gap in so many areas of health and life expectancy”. Regional economic ­development, welfare reform, targeted action to move people from welfare to economic participation and the use of local workforces for local jobs should be part of closing the gap.
 
 Indigenous enterprise, as Mr Mundine says, must be encouraged. And current circumstances present several opportunities. In far north Queensland, jobs for fruit pickers are going begging on the Atherton Tablelands and around Innisfail in the absence of overseas workers due to the COVID-19 crisis. The jobs are not being filled by workers from indigenous communities for want of a bus to transport them. And while it would be more complicated, the scandalous prices being charged for groceries in the Torres Strait Islands, up to five times as much as supermarket prices, should open the way for fresh competitors.
 
 Mr Mundine’s priorities broadly accord with the goals of Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt’s rewrite of Closing the Gap targets. That vital process, central to practical reconciliation, was introduced by the Rudd government in 2008 to reduce disadvantage among indigenous people and measure the improvement. After 12 annual reports, just two of the seven Closing the Gap targets have been achieved — early childhood education and Year 12 attainment. The process is ripe for an overhaul. But those achievements are a base for two of the new Closing the Gap goals. These are: increasing the proportion of Aborigines aged 25 to 34 who have completed a tertiary qualification (Certificate III or above); and increasing the proportion of young Aborigines (aged 15 to 24) who are in jobs, education or training. For some communities, these are highly ambitious goals. But as Mr Mundine bluntly warned: “If indigenous children don’t go to school, then into the workforce, they’re much more likely to end up in jail.” A child does not receive an effective education, as he said, if their school attendance falls below 90 per cent. In 2015 only 49 per cent of indigenous students met the critical 90 per cent attendance threshold. And in very remote areas, the figure was 21.9 per cent. Without major change, which must be motivated by families and communities, outcomes will not improve, regardless of resourcing. Detailed data and accountability will be essential to monitor progress.
 
 The major change in the Closing the Gap process envisaged by Mr Wyatt is the plan to hand indigenous bodies unprecedented responsibility, power and funding to improve health and education outcomes. The failures and limitations of earlier top-down approaches and encouraging developments on the ground suggest this is the way forward. Indigenous leader Pat Turner, who has worked with Mr Wyatt to overhaul the Closing the Gap process, represents 143 community-controlled indigenous health groups as chief executive of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation. The sector, she says, is in touch with grassroots people all over the country. Equal decision-making between governments and Aboriginal people at local, regional, state and national level, Ms Turner said, would achieve more than programs provided by “those sitting in ivory towers”. West Australian epidemiologist Fiona Stanley agrees. She points to the success of indigenous communities in limiting the COVID-19 outbreak as an example of what local groups can achieve: “If you give Aboriginal people control and support them” in true partnerships where they lead, “you get effective outcomes”. Ear, nose and throat surgeons working with speech pathologists, teachers and others to improve the health of indigenous children through the Deadly Ears project have found the same. Following the advice of community elders has resulted in the program being taken seriously, to the benefit of children’s ability to hear their teachers at school. Concurrent with the reforms to Closing the Gap, campaigners for a constitutionally enshrined indigenous voice to government also are stepping up their efforts. While also vitally important, that is a separate debate. But the overall picture shows indigenous people increasingly are ready, willing and able to take responsibility for their own lives. Doing so, Mr Mundine says, must include economic engagement, because he is unaware of “any race, community or group of people who have pulled themselves out of poverty without an economy”.",792
121,INDIGENOUS VOICE WILL BE HEARD LOUD AND PROUD,News,2020-04-26T14:40:01.438Z,"We have a chance to create a lasting, inclusive model
 
 The indigenous voice co-design process will move into high gear with the announcement of the membership of the national and local and regional co-design groups.
 
 The groups will be co-chaired by senior indigenous leaders Donna Odegaard and Peter Buckskin, respectively, supported by a government co-chair from the National Indigenous Australians Agency.
 
 We are under no illusions. This will be hard work, and the process is likely to ruffle feathers and challenge old ways of thinking. But we must effect real and permanent change for our people or this will be an opportunity lost.
 
 We have an opportunity to ­design our future. We are at the table with the Australian government. Make no mistake, this is a step forwards — and we encourage you to embrace this and ­engage with us.
 
 There has been, and will continue to be, distractions that try to disrupt our course — some welcome, others unnecessary, inflammatory and determined to set us backwards.
 
 We will persevere. We will not allow people to question our culture and resolve. We have overcome all adversity on this continent for more than 60,000 years. It is an unforgiving land, but our country has ingrained strength and resilience in us all.
 
 There are close to 800,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait ­Islander voices in this country today, and this will grow towards one million in the coming years. Diversity is another of our strengths. Our lived experiences will be key to designing systems that work for us.
 
 There are numerous representative bodies and structures already in place, and each of these will be critical to this process. We also know that states and territories have existing processes in place. Their integrity will not be undermined.
 
 Our role on the senior advisory group is to work through the co-design groups; hear, consider and record Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s aspirations for models; and advise the minister to ensure that views are heard by government.
 
 Throughout the process, we will continue to build understanding both across indigenous communities and with non-­indigenous Australians.
 
 We will support the work of the national and local and regional co-design groups, provide advice and input at key points, and ensure the process continues to move forward.
 
 The focus of the national group is to develop options and models for a national voice. It will work in partnership with the local and regional group at key points, to ensure that options for a ­national voice can be informed by, and connect with, local elements of a voice.
 
 In turn, the local and regional group will focus on local and regional models of decision-making and governance, including options to enhance this and highlight what’s already working. This will include considering how existing arrangements and structures feed into local and regional elements of a voice.
 
 Later in the year, we will be consulting on these models and options across the nation, ensuring they work for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the diversity of contexts and circumstances we find ourselves in today. Everyone will have an opportunity to have a say through this process. We will work with indigenous leaders, communities and stakeholders across the country to refine models.
 
 The groups have a lot of country to cover, and the weight of ­expectation of 800,000 people is significant. But we will remain ­focused on the opportunity ­before us.
 
 Though some say progress is slow in today’s hurried world, we must remember that lasting change takes time. This is an ­important process and we need to take the time to get it right or we risk losing the opportunity that has been presented to us. This is too important.
 
 The fight for rights over the past few decades will be an inspiration. We will honour the fight of our elders, past and present, in the work that we do and we will encourage our youth to share their vision for the future to ensure their voice is heard.
 
 Securing a future voice for our children, and their children, that presents the same opportunities and expectations as their non-­indigenous counterparts will be our purpose. Let’s not wait another 10 years or 100 years. Let’s continue this now.
 
 Help us, engage with us — and let’s create this future together.Marcia Langton and Tom Calma are co-chairs of the senior advisory group to co-design the indigenous voice to government.",766
122,Jailing is failing: Sydney doesn't need a new one,Fairfax,2020-08-22T12:21:46.390Z,"The NSW government
 
 has reportedly settled
 
 on the riverfront suburb of Camellia as the site
 
 for a major new prison to
 
 address massive overcrowding in the state's jails driven by successive governments' law and order policies.
 
 But before it takes another step towards construction, the government should first be required to provide evidence that building more prisons and incarcerating more people works to reduce crime, rehabilitate or makes the community safer.
 
 Every royal commission and parliamentary inquiry into prisons in Australia has recommended reducing the rate of imprisonment because the evidence is overwhelming that prisons do more harm than good.
 
 There is no evidence showing that higher prisoner numbers are a good use of our taxes or good for our society's safety.
 
 In fact, the evidence shows
 
 the opposite - jailing is failing
 
 in Australia.
 
 Being in prison does not rehabilitate - more than half of those who are sentenced to prison go back behind bars, and most go back many times.
 
 Upon release, most people come out worse than they went in: they are poorer, have even worse housing than when they went in and are unemployed.
 
 This costs the taxpayer
 
 even more in public health, unemployment and other
 
 support services.
 
 Half of those in prison today have at least one disability (mental health disorders and cognitive disabilities, and increasingly dementia) and drug addiction, raising the question as to why we use prisons for what are essentially social and community problems.
 
 And the extreme over-representation of Indigenous Australians in prison, two-thirds of whom have a disability, is a disaster for them and their communities as well as for the nation because this use of prison continues to fragment and undermine communities.
 
 Prisons are criminogenic - they perpetuate crime.
 
 This is not a call to close all prisons, because some dangerous people do need to be kept away from the community, but it is an evidence-based argument to use other proven successful means to keep our children, young people and communities safe.
 
 The overwhelming strength of this evidence has driven the establishment of the Justice Reform Initiative, a multi-partisan alliance working to show Australian governments that prevention and community-based options work better.
 
 Raising the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 (the average in continental Europe) or 15 (as in Nordic countries) would ensure children are not criminalised by being incarcerated.
 
 Reducing the number of Aboriginal and disadvantaged children being placed in out-of-home care is also essential as the rate of OOHC kids ending up in juvenile detention and then prison is far greater compared with the general community.
 
 Protecting children from sexual and domestic violence and supporting them properly if they are abused is critical as most adult prisoners and almost all women prisoners experienced abuse of some sort as young people.
 
 Increasing appropriate education and employment opportunities for disadvantaged people with a mental or cognitive disability works much better than being sent to prison.
 
 The War on Drugs has been a disaster with all public health and many justice officials acknowledging that it has just criminalised those at the bottom of the pile and created multibillion-dollar international drug cartels.
 
 Drug law reform, prevention and harm minimisation are far more effective than prison in reducing the harm done by drugs. And in Aboriginal communities, as called for in the Uluru Statement, listening to the elders and other community leaders, addressing intergenerational and current trauma and building capacity for self-determination, education, employment and strong and healthy families and communities are effective.
 
 Finally, how can the NSW government on the one hand aspire to the Premier's priority
 
 of reducing recidivism by 5 per cent and the intention of reducing the prison population by using more community-based orders (which was showing promise in 2019), while at the same time building yet another prison that will increase the numbers of people going in and coming out and re-offending.
 
 Sorry, Premier, this is selling NSW yet another expensive prison lemon.

123,Journey into the heart of whiteness,Others,2020-03-09T23:21:03.909Z,"Its opponents see it as a major threat to Western civilisation. But just how dangerous is Critical Race Theory? Karl Quinn reports.
 
 There's a good chance you've never heard of Critical Race Theory. But if its opponents are to be believed, this niche academic discipline poses the biggest threat to Western civilisation since the Dark Ages.
 
  Donald Trump has called it ""toxic propaganda"" that threatens to destroy America. British Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, a black woman of Nigerian parentage, last month told Parliament it leads to a ""segregated society"" and makes everything ""about the colour of your skin""; teaching it in British schools without offering an alternative view, she added, was ""illegal"". In Australia, the Murdoch media has railed against it for ""reducing people to a racial essence"" and judging them on the basis of ""group identity"" rather than ""individual character, behaviour and merit"".
 
  
 But what exactly is Critical Race Theory — CRT for short — and is it really as dangerous as all that?
 
 CRT has its origins in US law schools in the mid-1970s, as researchers began to ask why the legal advances won by the Civil Rights movement had produced so little improvement in the lives of minorities. The answer, they came to believe, lay in the way these new laws that supposedly guaranteed equal opportunity were being applied — and effectively resisted or undermined — by the courts. This was, they argued, ""systemic racism"" in action. ""Think how our system applauds affording everyone equality of opportunity,"" wrote Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic in their 2001 book Critical Race Theory: An Introduction, ""but resists programs that assure equality of results.""
 
 The term Critical Race Theory was coined in 1989 and the discipline has ebbed and flowed in the years since. In Britain and the United States it has found its way into the education system and workplaces in explicit terms, prompting Badenoch's speech in parliament and Trump's September edict that no government funding would go to federal diversity training programs that drew upon it ""because it's racist"".
 
 But in Australia it remains a minor field, cropping up in the odd humanities, law or politics department, though only occasionally labelled explicitly as CRT. For the most part, it's only in the occasional flare-ups on social media that we see its influence in this country.
 
 The language deployed around the Mukbang controversy at the Sydney Film Festival in June was typical. In drawing upon a Korean internet phenomenon and featuring a briefly seen anime-style drawing of a white girl strangling a black boy, the short film (directed by a young white woman) was guilty of cultural appropriation and racism, critics insisted. In awarding it a prize, and allowing the offending anime image to be removed after the fact, the festival was even more guilty, of both whitewashing and of upholding a ""white supremacist"" system (never mind that the festival's director, Nashen Moodley, is a South African-born person of colour).
 
 Condemnation flared again in August when the candidates for the Rob Guest Endowment, a $50,000 scholarship offered to an up-and-coming star of musical theatre, were announced — all of them white. There was outrage, a botched apology and finally the mass withdrawal of ""the 30 former semi-finalists"" in solidarity with ""artists identifying as First Nations and People of Colour"".
 
 This masthead found itself in the crosshairs in May when it appointed five emerging book critics — again, all of them white. Amid outrage at yet more evidence of ""white supremacy"" in action, two resigned, labelling the selection process ""a missed opportunity to support non-white voices in arts criticisms in Australia"". In August two new reviewers from diverse backgrounds were appointed.
 
 The accusations are typically fierce, and the apologies that follow often reek of the re-education camp.
 
 It's easy to be dismissive, to chime in with the tired observation that each one of these outbursts is just another case of ""political correctness gone mad"". But focusing on the doctrinaire nature of the language only obscures and distracts from the critique that informs it — and it's a critique that perhaps ought to be taken seriously if we are to avoid the ructions currently splitting American society.
 
 Broadly speaking, Critical Race Theory argues that the laws and institutions of Western societies only appear to be neutral; in truth, they discriminate against black, indigenous and other people of colour in ways that are often hard to see. The job of the anti-racist is to expose the workings of this systemic racism, and call it out.
 
 The key insight of CRT may be that it locates racism not just in the acts of individuals, but in a system that upholds, deliberately or not, inequality of outcome on the basis of race. It might manifest as racial profiling in policing, say, or failing to get into university because of the way eligibility is assessed (favouring tutored wealthy white kids over under-resourced kids in Indigenous communities, for example), or in the lack of diversity in particular kinds of workplaces.
 
  Tim Soutphommasane, professor of sociology and political theory at the University of Sydney and Australia's former Race Discrimination Commissioner, says CRT is not the only model for dissecting racism, and nor is it ""beyond reproach"". But for many people concerned with combating racism, ""there has long been the view that a liberal approach that focuses on individual attitudes and behaviours only gets you so far ... you can't understand racism without understanding how it involves power.""
 
 Plenty of white people who think of themselves as non-racists might find it hard to accept the idea that our institutions — education, employment, policing, the law, even health and welfare services — might be shot through with racism, and that they benefit from it. And for working-class whites struggling to pay the bills, the idea of ""white privilege"" is even harder to swallow (one reason why the issue has been so divisive in the US, and prompted many Democrats to vote for Trump).
 
 ""Many people still think you shouldn't be tagged as racist unless you subscribe to racial supremacist doctrine,"" Soutphommasane says. ""Many don't understand that racism is as much about systemic impact as it is about individual intention.""
 
 One of the key criticisms of CRT, particularly from the Right, is the way it identifies ""whiteness"" as an object of study — and a problem. But advocates insist there's an important distinction to be made between ""whiteness"" as a system of power, and ""white people"", who may or may not be ""allies"" in dismantling that structure in order to end racism.
 
 ""Any decent critical race work doesn't focus on the individual, but on the system, the structure,"" says race critical scholar Alana Lentin, an associate professor at the University of Western Sydney.
 
 One of the most widely cited ""proofs"" of CRT's inherent racism is history professor Ibram Kendi's assertion that to declare oneself ""not racist"" while doing nothing to actively combat racism is the same as actively being racist.
 
 ""Being anti-racist is not harmful,"" Claire Lehmann, founder of the liberal politics and philosophy website Quillette, has said. ""What is harmful is this notion ... that everything is either racist or anti-racist. That's a really damaging idea because it doesn't allow for neutrality.""
 
 Kendi's version of CRT — as articulated in his book How to be an Antiracist — would argue that neutrality is anything but. It would, for instance, cast the recent assertion by Wallabies coach Dave Rennie that players taking the knee before a match would be a ""political move"" in a very different light. Given the rise of the gesture around the world as a display of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and the campaign against racially motivated police violence against people of colour, not taking the knee would be seen as the real political statement.
 
 It's not only conservatives who have issues with CRT, though. Writing on the broader subject of cancel culture in the most recent issue of The Monthly, Waleed Aly observed that the insistence on calling out ""microaggressions"" (the tiny daily instances of discrimination, none prosecutable in their own right but collectively degrading) was counterproductive.
 
 ""In this world view, no act or comment is too small to be considered part of a system of oppression,"" Aly writes. ""[But] when nearly everything can be found problematic, when labels like 'white supremacist' can be hurled at most social behaviour and people, they flatten out the very idea of oppression.""
 
 For James Lindsay, host of the New Discourses podcast and a staunch critic of CRT, its real intent is to overthrow liberal society. It aims, he says, to ""awaken ... that awareness of oppression ... agitating people to see how bad their lives are even when they liked them, so that they would want to effect a revolution"".
 
 Or, as Australian writer, actor and Twitter activist Michelle Law put it in June, it seeks not to reform the system so much as to ""burn it all down"".
 
 But not everyone who identifies with CRT holds that view. Just as liberalism is a broad church encompassing everything from anti-government libertarians to pro-welfare interventionists, so CRT hosts a range of views.
 
 ""I haven't read anything in CRT literature that argues that white people are the only people who can perpetuate racism,"" says Amy Maguire, associate professor in law at the University of Newcastle. ""Whiteness theory situates whiteness in Western societies as the neutral or non-raced position, and situates non-white people as racialised/other. My read is that it would be possible for a non-white person to engage in racism against racialised communities in this type of framing.""
 
 CRT isn't a prescriptive set of rules, says Dr Tess Ryan, president of the Australian Critical Race and Whiteness Studies Association and an Indigenous woman of Birapai descent from Taree in NSW. ""There are a lot of learnings from the US and Europe and the UK that need to be nuanced and adapted to the Australian situation.""
 
 It would at any rate be hard to pretend inequity and racism do not exist in Western societies (or in non-Western societies for that matter). And if we agree on that we have a choice: to accept it as the natural order or to try to change it.
 
 CRT demands change. In some versions it seeks to force people into extreme positions - of black victim and white supremacist, or of self-flagellating white ally - that do little to help us find a middle path to a better, post-racist society.
 
 But, says Dr Ryan, it doesn't need to be that way. ""You don't have to walk down the street slapping yourself. It's about recognising and acknowledging, and that's not hard to do.""",0
124,Just change one word and let us move on to real reform,News,2021-06-28T00:32:41.094Z,"LET’S just be done with the national anthem and change it once and for all to Daryl Braithwaite’s Horses.
 
 Imagine a World Cup rugby final at Twickenham. As New Zealanders reach for the hankies after a rousing rendition of Slice of Heaven by Dave Dobbyn, their new national anthem, replacing God Defend New Zealand, we join hands for “that’s the way it’s gonna be, little darlin’, we’ll be riding on the horses, yeah ... way up in the sky, little darlin’, and if you fall I’ll pick you up, pick you up.’’ Magnificent. Uplifting. Embodies the true spirit of Australia. Oh, the animal welfare zealots are complaining that we’re demonising horses. Forget it.
 
 Why are we tying ourselves in knots about changing the word in a national anthem when we are failing the very people we are trying to impress?
 
 There’s a debate going on right now on whether we should change the lyrics of Advance Australia Fair to “better acknowledge the nation’s Indigenous history’’.
 
 In fact, if the Australian Rugby League Commission had its way, the national anthem wouldn’t even be played at State of Origin games. The league’s governing body had decided to jettison the national anthem but an outcry forced a quick backflip. During the rendition of Advance Australia Fair at Origin games, many of the Indigenous players do not sing the national anthem. Fair enough, it’s a free country.
 
 But now there’s a fresh move to change the lyrics of Advance Australia Fair, changing “for we are young and free’ to “for we are one and free’’. The call for the change is coming from political and Indigenous heavyweights, including NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian.
 
 Let’s just do it. The anthem has been changed on a number of occasions to reflect modern values but there should be one caveat from the NRL. One rule. Every player must sing every word. If they don’t, dock them their $50,000 match fee.
 
 This constant debate around whether we should celebrate Australia Day on January 26 or sing the national anthem at big events is nebulous.
 
 At a time when the Indigenous communities in this country have the highest incarceration, domestic violence, sexual assault, alcoholism and drug rates of any specific demographic, we’re debating the lyrics to a song? Or changing a date because a few woke councils think it’s a good idea?
 
 If Indigenous footy players were serious, they’d donate their annual salaries to programs aimed at improving the social equity and justice of their people.
 
 Let’s do the maths. Twenty of our top Indigenous NRL and AFL players earning $600,000-$800,000 a year means a donation of near $15m. That would go a long way towards helping Indigenous communities address these problems. Or would it? A recent major Productivity Commission report into Indigenous funding showed little evidence that current programs are effective.
 
 The nation’s chief economic adviser has called for a complete overhaul of the billions of dollars pumped into Indigenous care.
 
 Despite billions in funding, school attendance, child mortality, employment, life expectancy and numeracy and literacy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hasn’t improved. When it comes to improving the lot of our First Nations people, actions speak louder than the words of a song.

125,LEFT IS FIGHTING TO CONTROL OUR HIGH COURT,News,2020-05-25T14:08:53.991Z,"Progressives worry their lofty power base could be eroded by legal conservatives The progressive reaction to calls for capital-C legal conservatives to be appointed to the High Court — that it would politicise the judiciary — is an insincere attempt to retain its power over the legal establishment.
 
 The High Court’s decision in February that indigenous Australians should be treated differently in the Constitution because of their racial identity was the most radical judgement in Australian history. It destroyed the idea that Australians have about multiculturalism that there was one law in Australia and that everyone was subject to the law in the same way.
 
 The case concerned attempts by the commonwealth government to detain and deport two individuals who were not Australian citizens and who had failed their migration character tests as a result of being convicted criminals. The individuals descended from indigenous Australians but were born overseas.
 
 The individuals argued — and a majority on the High Court agreed — that a person with these characteristics could not be subject to the commonwealth’s constitutional power to make laws with respect to aliens. The court developed a new category of person — non-alien, non-citizen — based on the idea that people of indigenous Australian descent forever “belonged” to the continent in a way that could not apply to others.
 
 The decision distorted the common law to import a new and incomprehensible legal principle that has fundamentally reshaped the relationship Australians have with each other and with the Australian Constitution.
 
 This has emboldened calls for a change in how judicial appointments are made and the kinds of judges who are appointed to Australian courts.
 
 Predictably, this has been met with accusations that conservatives are attempting to make “blatantly political appointments”, as the Judicial Conference of Australia’s president, Judith Kelly, remarked in The Australian last month.
 
 In this reading the High Court’s decision — which until this case was an inconceivable and unimaginable outcome — was a merit-based resolution and the rejecting of this new orthodoxy is inappropriately partisan.
 
 What is happening in Australia is a reflection of something similar in the US. Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democratic Party in the US Senate, on Wednesday threatened Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the two judges nominated to the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump.
 
 “I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh — you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions,” Schumer told the cheering crowd in response to a hearing into a state law restricting abortion.
 
 Schumer’s subsequent apology was likely influenced by the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts’s rare rebuke calling the comments “not only inappropriate” but “dangerous”.
 
 The instinct to respond in this way is a manifestation of a shared problem. The cultural left has (in Australia) or had (in the US) an uncontested stranglehold on the legal establishment, and is eager to retain that control.
 
 The allegation that conservatives are seeking a political takeover of the courts is wrong. The call from legal conservatives for judges with a conservative disposition to be appointed is in response to the century-long politicisation of the courts by progressive judges. Over this time the Australian Constitution has routinely been rewritten to give untrammelled lawmaking power to the federal government in distant Canberra, dismantle the federal structure, and now to divide Australians on the basis of their racial identity.
 
 The question of what describes a legal conservative includes rejecting the judicial activism that has been a staple of the Australian High Court. Judicial activism is the name of the broad philosophy of judges to import their own values into the Constitution. This is sometimes called “living tree” constitutionalism because the constitutional structure is a growing and evolving entity that needs to be updated by the courts to align with the modern situation.
 
 The obvious problem with this philosophy is that this is fundamentally subjective. Under this school of thought any judge could determine which cultural evolution they would like to import into the Constitution. In any given era the values of the court will change, meaning that over time the judgments of the High Court would be unpredictable but could nonetheless rewrite how the country is governed.
 
 The law is what the politicians intend for it to mean, but judges in Australia have interpreted this to mean that the law is whatever a judge decides it should be.
 
 Due to the important work of organisations such as the Federalist Society, legal conservatism is now firmly ensconced as a mainstream philosophy in the American legal establishment. As the comments from Senator Schumer demonstrate, this has been viciously resisted as a threat to the left’s institutional hold on power. The left in Australia knows and fears the same could happen here.Morgan Begg is a research fellow at the Institute of Public Affairs",837
126,Let's call it a wrap on the shocker of a year that was 2020,Others,2021-02-13T00:50:21.347Z,"At this time of year, it's customary to look back - to reflect on the things that have happened and how we have come out the other side.
 
 However, 2020 has been a singular year, in that instead of the usual 12 months it seemed to have taken about 4325 of them to get to December.
 
 Was it really only a year ago that bushfires scorched 24 million hectares of our sunburnt country? Thirty-three people perished, 3000 homes were lost, and 3 billion animals were either killed or displaced. The international community stood with us by sending in donations and even overseas firefighters to help us fight the flames, while our skies turned ruby as many retreated to the beaches for rescue. Here on the NSW-Victoria border, the air was thick with smoke, and an orange hue glazed our horizons as an ever-present reminder of how we were living on the whims of the wind.
 
 I thought this would be the defining event of 2020. Then someone ate a bat in China and the world all but imploded.
 
 Some of us wish we were movie stars, but soon we all found ourselves in what felt like some sort of end-of-days horror flick. These apocalyptic films got one thing wrong - we weren't fighting over water or, you know, life-sustaining food. No, supermarkets were literally hiring security guards to protect new shipments of toilet paper, and to break up fights between people willing to fight to the death over two-ply. We were going - ahem - batshit crazy over loo rolls. Not our proudest moment.
 
 In Australia we fared better than most. We've had just over 28,000 cases and just under 1000 deaths from coronavirus, but each of those 908 losses was felt keenly, and we've suffered the aftershocks deeply.
 
 We've seen monumental stuff-ups like the Ruby Princess and hotel quarantine breaches. We've seen the struggles of Victoria battling under harsh restrictions and total lockdown. We've seen both international and state border closures. And we've seen total public idiocy as people flout the rules and continue to do whatever they want without masks or social distancing, despite outbreaks in what we'd all hoped was our recovery phase.
 
 We saw our government finally raise social security payments to a figure that put recipients just over the poverty line (well la-di-da), but ministers were careful to remind us that this was temporary. It was clear that the raise in income support was to ensure our economy didn't completely collapse rather than to give us the misguided impression vulnerable people should be helped to, you know, survive. Now it's Christmas, this rate has been reduced to the point of poverty again. I think I might die of not-surprise.
 
 During the height of the pandemic in Australia, 2.3 million Australians - that's one in five working Australians - either experienced unemployment or reduced hours. We've had to rethink not just how we do business, but what our business should be. But wait, there's more.
 
 The death of George Floyd in the United States served to shine a much-needed light on racism in our own society, but especially on black deaths in custody. In Australia, 434 Aboriginal people have died in police and prison custody, and there has been a staggering 857 per cent increase in the incarceration rate of Aboriginal women since 1991. Maybe ""we didn't start the fire"", but it's our job not to continue to fan the flames.
 
 We've lost so much this year. I think the only hope we have to escape 2020 in one piece, is for all of us to close our eyes and yell ""JUMANJI"" at midnight on New Year's Eve. I'm keen to leave this jungle, aren't you?

127,LET’S NEVER CONCEDE TO THE MORAL MATRIX OF THE TRIBE,News,2020-12-25T05:07:59.863Z,"A once-great bastion of journalism now a failed symbol of posturing identity politics
 
 Events in America, notably at The New York Times, once the shining light of journalistic inquiry, reveal how identity politics can ruin liberal institutions, undermine the foundations of journalism and compromise the fragile role of reason in public debate.
 
 With America in trauma, consumed by a frontline political war that is not replicated here — Trumpian populists against progressive believers — it is illuminating that Australian activists opportunistically seek to translate the American mood, slogans and demands to this country. Identity politics does not require historical knowledge.
 
 Social media activists operate in a world of technology-driven globalisation where what happens in an American city has the same relevance as what happens down the road. This telescopic vision is then driven by subcultures — based on race, gender and sexuality — and a new morality where people are deemed good or bad depending on their identity and place in the power structure.
 
 The ideology of “systemic racism” condemns the power structure. The problem becomes the system, not aspects of the system that need reform. Herein lies the essential problem — once you accept critical race theory — that racism is everywhere and permeates everything, you create an end-goal that will never be realised but delivers endless anger.
 
 This paradigm is about power — a new moral culture dividing us into victims and oppressors. The mantra is “us versus them”. Once this takes hold prospects for co-operation are lost.
 
 The reason this is so dangerous, as American social psychologist Jonathan Haidt says, is that inclusive liberalism is not the natural order for humanity. The natural order is tribalism. The quest of political theorists from the dawn of time has been to create structures that negate tribal passions and allow people with different outlooks and identities to live together — the central achievement of liberalism. But now we are revert­ing. As Haidt said: “Once we bind ourselves more tightly to the group, we embrace the group’s moral matrix and we stop thinking for ourselves. In tribal mode, we seem to go blind to arguments and information that challenge our team’s narrative.” It’s an assault on reason and sections of the Australian media have become a case study. Black deaths in custody are driven by several factors — the high indigenous incarceration rate, its link to intolerably high levels of entrenched family violence and child abuse within indigenous families, police practices and racism. But in per capita terms non-indigenous deaths in prison are higher.
 
 The mantra from the street — that the problem is white police murdering Aboriginals in jail — is wrong. After saying this, it is essential to point out that some Abor­igines have been killed by police. So have white people. The media’s job is to analyse the tragedy with empathy. Yet much of the media is frightened to do this. The attitude seems to be: if you support the protests you cannot publish material that might undermine the cause.
 
 This brings us to The New York Times. Its opinion editor, James Bennet, was forced to resign after publishing a piece by Republican senator Tom Cotton calling on the federal government to deploy troops to restore law and order to the cities, as Donald Trump threatened.
 
 Bennet defended his decision against a staff rebellion, saying it would undermine the integrity and independence of the newspaper “if we only published views that editors like me agreed with and it would betray what I think of as our fundamental purpose — not to tell you what to think but to help you think for yourself”. That didn’t cut it. Bennet had to quit.
 
 Polls showed more than half of Americans agreed with Cotton. His tone was hardly inflammatory as he drew the distinction between the majority of peaceful protesters and bands of miscreants. He wanted troops deployed as other presidents had done since World War II.
 
 With a staff and readers’ revolt, the paper decided publication had been wrong. Its readers should not have been exposed to the article. It constituted a negation of The New York Times’ values.
 
 The paper’s prejudice against Trump is legendary — and that’s distinct from reasoned and ethical arguments against Trump, which are in abundance. Given Trump’s 2016 victory, the media had a decision to make — to report and analyse what had happened or move to the left, embrace a radical identity politics stance and become educated activists in the effort to defeat him. The New York Times is case study in what media organisations have done to themselves in the Trump era. But the paper allowed some regular columnists to dissent.
 
 Bret Stephens wrote the decision was “a gift to the enemies of a free press”. He said: “There is a spirit of ferocious intellectual intolerance sweeping the country and much of the journalistic establishment with it. Contrary opinions aren’t just wrong but unworthy of discussion. The range of political views deemed morally unfit for publication seems to grow ever wider. Arthur Miller once said a good newspaper is ‘a nation talking to itself’. What kind of paper will The Times be if half the nation doesn’t get to be even an occasional part of the conversation?” Columnist Ross Douthat said of the Cotton op-ed that if the argument “looks wrong within a few days of its publication” that is precisely the purpose of a robust op-ed page. He said its provocative tone had “many equivalents in left-learning pieces that we publish”. The double standard was ­blatant.
 
 There is, of course, no columnist on the paper who supports Trump. More significant, however, was its confused alternative view of American history. This was exemplified in its 1619 Project on slavery last year. The paper decided the “true” founding of America was not the 1776 Declaration of Independence but in 1619 when the first African slaves arrived. The newspaper purported to discover the “true” nature of America.
 
 In his critique of this project journalist Andrew Sullivan wrote: “True is a strong word. 1776, the authors imply, is a smokescreen to distract you from the overwhelming reality of white supremacy as America’s ‘true’ identity. Hence the insistence that everything about America today is related to that same slavocracy — biased medicine, brutal economics, confounding traffic, destructive financial crises, the 2016 election and even our expanding waistlines!” The Times announced it was “finally time to tell our story truthfully”. As Sullivan said, all previous accounts of America’s history must have been lies — now The Times had unveiled the truth. And here is the problem. If you believe the task of journalism is to propagate “truth”, then you abandon the liberal tradition of debate, different views and analysis. If you know the “truth” you don’t need a process to probe its complexity. You don’t run the Cotton op-ed.
 
 You don’t debate what Trump does because you assume his evil forfeits any such right. You support the street protesters, their cause and ethics because they reflect “truth”.
 
 The Times engages in fake diversity. It is the diversity of identity politics. But the Cotton event exposes another reality — identity politics leads to conformity, a suppression of views and positions.
 
 Indeed, this is its logic: the real lesson from the Cotton saga. This is not to say newsrooms should not be diverse. They should, and the issue should be pressed. But measuring diversity just by input — the race, colour or sex of journalists — is fake. What matters is output, the journalistic product, its integrity, whether issues of extreme sensitivity are confronted by robust intellectual debate or whether this is deemed to be offensive and immoral.
 
 Injustice to the indigenous peoples demands constant acknowledgment and rectification. It is dubious, however, to see how identity politics, with its fanning of division, its location in emotion and feeling and its insistence on endless white apology, offers anything but a destructive stalemate in facing indigenous disadvantage. The pressure in Australia now to repress, curb and censor opinion and debate in the media is real. It is having an impact. Who decides what is “truth”? Journalists who decide they are the truth-tellers to the exclusion of other views will find they advance neither truth nor their legitimacy.",1401
128,LET’S SLASH INDIGENOUS SENTENCES BY A QUARTER,News,2020-05-30T14:46:57.729Z,"Too many Aborigines are in jail and we need to act now on this national tragedy Last year was yet another in which activists were quick to jump on to fashionable causes such as rights in the form of privacy and freedom of expression and religion.
 
 Passed over yet again was a brutal practice in this country that should have rights campaigners shouting in unison, one that should shame Australia as a nation and that, remarkably, is worsening: the systematic and deliberate mass incarceration of indigenous offenders undermines Australia’s human rights credibility around the world.
 
 One in 50 indigenous people is in prison. The indigenous incarceration rate is 1949 per 100,000 adult population. It is 168 per 100,000 non-indigenous Australians.
 
 The cruel manner in which the criminal justice system treats indigenous Australians is compounded by the fact that on a range of other social and economic measures, they are the most disadvantaged people in our community.
 
 The problem of indigenous prisoner over-representation is not new. Nor is it a problem that is under-reported. The problem has been described as “a national disgrace and international embarrassment” by the Law Council of Australia. NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman said there was “no question that the level of indigenous incarceration in Australia continues to be a national tragedy and a major concern to the NSW government”. Former federal attorney-general George Brandis also called indigenous over-incarceration a “national tragedy”.
 
 The federal government commissioned (another) report into the problem, Pathways to Justice, more than a year ago. That document made more than 30 recommendations. They have not been acted on and, in any event, the recommendations are vague and lacking in specifics to make any concrete difference. Further, in 2013 the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen held that extreme social and economic disadvantage can mitigate a sentence’s severity.
 
 So there has been no end of good intentions for ameliorating the problem of indigenous over-incarceration. But all these fine words, proposals for reform, and hopes for a fairer future have amounted to nothing. Not a single indigenous person will ever be spared an unjustified prison term if we just wish for it. We have not achieved zero on this issue. Indeed, we have achieved less. Things are going backwards.
 
 For all the political and community concern about fixing the indigenous incarceration crisis, the number of indigenous prisoners is rising. There are 3 per cent more indigenous people in prison than a year ago. Worse still, the rate of indigenous incarceration has risen by almost half in the past decade.
 
 The mass incarceration of indigenous Australians is the most serious human rights crisis of our nation and our time. Imprisonment is the most coercive and harshest sanction that we as a community impose on individuals. It can destroy much of what is meaningful to a person’s life. It can also significantly set back the interests and flourishing of family members of prisoners. We are well past the time for immediate reforms that will start working today.
 
 More meetings by well-intentioned public servants, leading to expansive, glossy reports with their dot-point executive summaries and indexes, and long thank-you lists and copious superbly formatted footnotes, are not action. It is almost the opposite.
 
 The best approach to reducing the unfair and discriminatory burden that our criminal justice system inflicts on indigenous Australians (who are about twice as likely to be imprisoned even for the same offence as non-indigenous offenders) is to provide a concrete mathematical sentencing discount for such offenders.
 
 The discount that is appropriate is 25 per cent. The reason for this figure is that it is roughly the same as that conferred for an early guilty plea in most Australian jurisdictions and experience has shown that the discount is substantial enough to change behaviour (for example, encourage guilty pleas) but not so large as to undermine the integrity of the sentencing system. The need to reduce indigenous prison numbers is more compelling than the desire to encourage more guilty pleas.
 
 Given the total lack of effective action to reduce indigenous prison numbers, this reform proposal should be extended to serving prisoners. All indigenous prisoners should have their sentence reduced by a quarter. This would mean that indigenous prisoners who have completed three-quarters or more of their prison term should be immediately released from custody.
 
 It may sound a drastic step to retrospectively cut the length of prison terms, but it is not unprecedented. In response to the mass incarceration crisis in the US, federal legislatures passed the First Step Act in December 2018, which retrospectively reduces prison terms for thousands of federal prisoners who are incarcerated for nonviolent offences. Moreover, the incarceration rate of African-Americans has dropped by more than 30 per cent in recent years.
 
 It is a stain on our international reputation that we now imprison a higher portion of indigenous Australians than a supposedly more racially divided America imprisons African-Americans. The distrust and anger generated among Australians over this obvious injustice is completely understandable.
 
 The recommendation to reduce prison terms for indigenous offenders by 25 per cent might sound like a blunt instrument for change. But it will work to reduce indigenous prison numbers by approximately the same percentage. The result will be greatly improved lives for so many indigenous offenders, their families and their communities. Indeed, for us all. The social dividend would greatly outweigh what some might see as the costs of this proposal, especially when no one seems to have workable alternative solutions. We are past the point of relying on good intentions to fix anything.Professor Mirko Bagaric is the dean of the Swinburne University Law School and the author of Sentencing in Australia.",975
129,LET’S WORK FOR INDIGENOUS JOBS,News,2020-09-21T14:27:22.935Z,"We have a unique opportunity now to shift the dial towards employment parity The impacts and opportunities of crises do not fall evenly across our society. An inconvenient truth of the COVID-19 pandemic is that Indigenous Australians will bear a disproportionate burden of job losses.
 
 Although the saying “last in, first out” might not sit comfortably for some, it is a reality that Indigenous workers are faced with in periods of economic downturn.
 
 But with every crisis comes opportunity. In this moment we are presented a unique possibility to shift the dial on Indigenous employment as we rebuild our economy and shape our future workforce.
 
 Before the pandemic, employment figures reflected a disproportionately small Indigenous labour force, including both Indigenous people in work and looking for work. And yet, from this base, unemployment was still excessively high — about three times the average.
 
 Youth unemployment presents additional complexities. Australia-wide, youth aged 15-24 face unemployment rates more than double the average. Considering that half the Indigenous Australian population is under 24, the double whammy of being young and Indigenous imposes the toughest job prospects on our young and future generations.
 
 Considering other characteristics of the Indigenous workforce such as overall lower educational attainment, proportionately more casual workers and proportionately fewer professionals and managers, we can begin to understand the critical warning signs for Indigenous employment in a time of crisis.
 
 From this standpoint, many employers and jobseekers alike are looking to realise a new status quo in Indigenous employment through the disruption of COVID-19. Coles is one such example. In the rush to meet customer demand and panic buying, Coles used the opportunity to recruit more than 400 Indigenous team members in four weeks. Despite the economic headwinds of a pandemic, Coles — already one of Australia’s largest employers of Indigenous people — boosted its Indigenous workforce by another 10 per cent.
 
 The opportunity for Indigenous employment parity is bolstered by the new National Agreement on Closing the Gap, which progressed through final negotiations amid the backdrop of the pandemic. Announced last Thursday, the 16 new targets include a more ambitious Indigenous employment goal, as well as a specific target for the proportion of Indigenous youth in employment, education or training.
 
 As we turn our attention to how to create the jobs of the future in a post-COVID nation, the focus on Indigenous employment must be a priority.
 
 The Business Council of Australia estimates two million jobs will need to be created in the near term to help those on JobSeeker find work, and re-employ people on JobKeeper in companies that may need to restructure. How many of these jobs will go to Indigenous Australians?
 
 For 3 per cent parity 60,000 of these jobs must go to Indigenous Australians. These 60,000 jobs represent more than 10 per cent of the working-age Indigenous population, and roughly a 25 per cent increase in the number of Indigenous Australians employed today. Here’s a real chance to make meaningful progress in meeting the employment targets.
 
 While this is ambitious, we know employers are up for the challenge. More than 60,000 Indigenous jobs were pledged by more than 350 employers through the Australian Employment Covenant, spearheaded by Andrew Forrest. Now is the time to reignite this push for parity.
 
 Prioritising Indigenous employment does not need to come at the expense of other Closing the Gap targets. Indeed, employment targets are the precursor to all the others. We recently saw this in action when Indigenous people employed in positions of influence took decisive action to protect their communities from COVID-19. As a result, there was a disproportionately low number of COVID-19 cases among Indigenous Australians.
 
 This pandemic has the chance to become an inflection point in the journey towards Indigenous parity. While we have the chance, let’s shape our future workforce and economy to be an inclusive one.
 
 Inclusive growth does not happen by accident and needs planning, investment, and constant management. In the federal government’s recently announced $2bn JobTrainer skills package, Indigenous workforce development must be a core component. In auditing the interstate fly-in, fly-out arrangements of resources companies, regional and Indigenous employment must be prioritised.
 
 Despite the mountainous challenges the pandemic presents, the disruption is causing many policymakers and our society to rethink the way we do things.
 
 From adversity comes opportunity, and what better opportunity than an inclusive economic recovery. The time is right for this thinking and reform.
 
 Let’s not look back in 10 years and lament yet another missed opportunity for a path towards achieving parity. Let’s get to work.

130,Looking out for the most vulnerable in community,News,2020-01-23T01:22:14.877Z,"Pandemic is an opportunity to show true Australian spirit
 
 Australia in isolation — our borders closed, returned travellers and new arrivals in 14-day self-quarantine — is a daunting work in progress. Social distancing has entered the lexicon, with gatherings of more than 500 people scrubbed. Anzac Day services and agricultural shows have been halted. Scott Morrison says the comparator to the coronavirus pandemic is the Spanish flu of 100 years ago. This time, however, the states and territories are better co-ordinated and resourced in the national response. Anyone aged under 75 will be tempted to think this is what life during wartime must be like. Still, the Prime Minister emphasised in back-to-back morning TV and radio interviews on Monday that life goes on. “The shops remain open, the trains still run, the phones still work, the lights still switch on,” he said. “This is not a physical disaster where you’ve had a cyclone or something like that.” People, however, are a little bewildered at the shutdown, feeling swamped by the dislocations and the accumulation of dilemmas about what to do to limit the risks of being infected, beyond the commonsense precautions of handwashing, sneezing properly, not shaking hands and the like. These are early days but the restrictions could last for six months, perhaps a little more or a little less, according to Mr Morrison. The strategy, driven by medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, is to slow the rate of infection — “flatten the curve” — which allows the health system to better respond; that reduces the risk to the elderly and saves lives. The main goal is to stop medical facilities being overwhelmed, given the number of COVID-19 infections is now doubling every few days.
 
 For many parents and some medical experts, the decision not to close schools is perplexing. Independent schools are moving ahead of state authorities with closures, putting online learning environments to the test. Even if assemblies and sports are cancelled, parents wonder how can it be prudent to have hundreds of students massed in corridors at the change of lessons? It’s counterintuitive, but officials say closing schools could create more problems than solutions. Mr Morrison t on Monday said the impact on younger people is actually much less than for the rest of the population. But if school students were forced home, they would need to be cared for, perhaps by older Australians, their grandparents, he said. “That is not a particularly good idea at the moment. And it would also take, potentially, nurses and others out of the workforce when we need them right now,” the Prime Minister said.
 
 Right now, the highest priority must be protecting the health of the most vulnerable in our community and easing the effects of the disruption to food supplies and other essential services to them. To this end, the major supermarkets have announced they will introduce special shopping hours for the elderly and disabled. Retailers have been swamped by home delivery requests, as well as having their shelves stripped of items; they’re putting on a reserve army of casuals to cope. The run on supermarkets, however, is an opportunity for neighbours to step up and help socially isolated people. It may have sounded trite a few weeks ago when Mr Morrison suggested to take around a curry to rural folks who don’t have access to Uber Eats. But his advice on Sunday to drop off a casserole to those in need, as an act of kindness, suits the times. As well as exercising restraint in the grocery shopping stakes.
 
 More delicate to design will be the imminent restrictions on aged-care facilities, which the national cabinet will consider on Tuesday evening. Britain is planning a dramatic four-month mass quarantine of everyone over 70 in the most drastic measure yet unveiled in the fight against COVID-19. UK nursing homes and other aged-care centres face being locked down for the same period. Mr Morrison has flagged there will be a “fairly significant restriction on visitation to people in nursing homes”. He said measures would be sensitively implemented, given families would possibly be seeing elderly relatives for the last time. But he explained the prime goal was “to lessen the broader risk for people in these facilities”. Undoubtedly, amid distress, it will be a difficult balance to strike.
 
 The health of indigenous people, especially those living in remote areas and suffering high rates of chronic disease, is another priority. Northern Territory authorities have banned non-essential travel into bush communities and advised residents not to leave. The draconian-sounding measures are aimed at limiting the spread of the virus and stopping doctors in the already strained system from making life-and-death decisions. Indigenous leaders are rightly demanding more medicines, masks, equipment and clinicians be allocated to these communities.Protecting our most vulnerable people invariably requires harsher restrictions on movement and services, as well as more dedicated resources. But it will also call for displays of Australian spirit, acts of kindness to strangers, self-control and patience. The way we interact with Nanna and Pop, for instance, may change for the next several months: less face time and more FaceTime. Try to look out for the elderly in your street or apartment building. As the Prime Minister has said, our job in the coming days, weeks and months is to work together to slow the spread of the virus. For those of us who are more healthy, we have a duty to protect the most vulnerable. As a US president once said, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country, your local community, your fellow Australian.",967
131,Missing the target,Fairfax,2021-05-09T08:22:38.010Z,"There may be goodwill but the huge gulf between the length and quality of life for Indigenous Australians and the broader community remains entrenched, write Nick O'Malley and Matt Wade.
 
 On the 12th anniversary of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations on Wednesday Kevin Rudd, who delivered the apology as his first act as prime minister in 2008, attended a breakfast to celebrate the event at NSW Parliament House, as he does each year.
 
 The tone of the speakers captured the grief for the survivors of the forced removals of children and for the shattered generations that followed, relief and joy that the terrible injustice had finally been formally recognised and celebration of Indigenous Australians' resilience and determination.
 
 But overshadowing the event was grim news from Canberra. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison had given the 12th annual Closing the Gap address, a report to Parliament on how the government has fared in redressing inequality between Indigenous Australians and the broader community. The Closing the Gap targets were adopted by the Rudd government after it offered the apology and cover health (life expectancy, child mortality) education (early childhood education, literacy and numeracy, year 12 attainment) and employment.
 
 According to Morrison's report only two of the targets were on track to be met - the goal to have 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025 and the goal to halve the gap for Indigenous Australians aged 20-24 in year 12 attainment or equivalent attainment rates by 2020.
 
 The huge gulf between the length and quality of life on those other measures remained entrenched. ""For 12 years, I have sat in this chamber and listened to Closing the Gap speeches,"" said Morrison. ""It's a tale of hope, frustration and disappointment. A tale of good intentions. Indeed good faith. But the results are not good enough."" Labor Leader Anthony Albanese said the failure to achieve five of the seven ""modest"" targets was ""tragic"".
 
 Though the apology and the Closing the Gap measures had been adopted by the Rudd government through different processes, they have always inextricably linked. As Rudd told the Herald, an apology untethered to concrete measures of redress and accountability would risk devolving into empty rhetoric.
 
 Offering a Welcome to Country at the breakfast, chairwoman of Sydney's Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council Yvonne Weldon noted that Aboriginal suffering could not be allowed to become a memorial in itself.
 
 In various speeches and public statements made this week, the lines can be traced of an ongoing debate about the apparently constant failures of Closing the Gap. Morrison told Parliament that, ""despite the best intentions, investments in new programs and bipartisan goodwill, Closing the Gap has never really been a partnership with Indigenous people.
 
 ""We perpetuated an ingrained way of thinking passed down over two centuries and more, and it was the belief that we knew better than our Indigenous peoples. We don't. We also thought we understood their problems better than they did. We don't. They live them. We must see the gap we wish to close, not from our viewpoints, but from the viewpoint of Indigenous Australians.""
 
 He advocated for a new approach on Closing the Gap that would be ""more locally led and more collaborative [which] will take us much further than the top-down, one-size-fits-all, government-led approach ever could"".
 
 Pat Turner, the co-chair of the Joint Council on Closing the Gap - which includes representatives of state, federal and local governments as well as from the national Coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peak Organisations - echoed some of those sentiments. ""Governments say they are listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,"" she said. ""However, the true test in listening is translating the priority reforms into real, tangible and funded actions that make a difference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people right across our country.""
 
 She also warned of the destructive impact of constant failure to meet the targets. ""The danger of this seemingly endless cycle of failure is that it breeds complacency and cynicism, while excusing those in power,"" she said. ""People begin to believe that meaningful progress is impossible and there is nothing governments can do to improve the lives of our people.""
 
 Rudd rejects elements of this argument. ""Closing the Gap was not invented by a bunch of white fellas,"" he said in his speech on Thursday morning. ""It was provided to us by the Aboriginal social justice commissioner Tom Calma's report in 2005, calling on us as a nation to close the gap between white Australians and black Australians. We listened.""
 
 Calma, now the Chancellor of the University of Canberra, says his report spurred an activist movement called Close the Gap which in turn evolved into the Closing the Gap strategy. He agrees in the process the targets the government reported on were defined by bureaucrats rather than the Indigenous bodies and campaigners that started the process.
 
 Australian National University's Professor Nicholas Biddle, who researches demographic and socioeconomic outcomes for Indigenous Australians, says the objective to reduce the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians was the starting point. ""That was Indigenous led and Indigenous driven and then other targets were added to it and adapted along the way,"" he says.
 
 The targets have not been static. A seventh goal on Indigenous school attendance rates was added by the Council of Australian Governments in 2014. And four of the seven targets set in 2008 were due to expire in 2018 so the government developed the Closing the Gap ""refresh"" where targets would be updated in partnership with Indigenous people.
 
 Former prime minister Julia Gillard said 2013 was a ""significant year"" for Closing the Gap because the first of the targets would be achieved - ensuring all Indigenous four-year-olds living in remote communities has access to early childhood education within five years.
 
 But some targets have been on track one year then off track the next. The 2019 report revealed the goal to narrow the difference between Indigenous and non-Indigenous child mortality, for instance, was not being met despite being on track in previous years.
 
 These fluctuations make it difficult to gauge the effectiveness of long-term policy settings, says Biddle.
 
 On top of that, the targets vary greatly in scale and complexity, meaning some will be easier to achieve than others. Biddle describes several as ""intermediate goals"" - such as getting children to attend school - while others are hugely ambitious ""end goals"", such as lifting rates of numeracy and literacy and extending life expectancy.
 
 He points out the two targets achieved so far - on pre-schools enrolments and year 12 attainment - are in areas where governments have some direct control.
 
 However, Biddle says improvements to the way social and economic data is collected and evaluated is one lasting positive from the Closing the Gap agenda.
 
 The lack of progress over a prolonged period has raised concerns the Closing the Gap measures may have helped entrench a ""deficits view"" of Australia's Indigenous population.
 
 Professor Heidi Norman, a researcher at the University of Technology, Sydney, and descendant of the Gomeroi people of north-western NSW, says the Closing the Gap targets seemed reasonable when first announced but had, over time, constructed ""Aboriginal people as deficit in need of meeting a norm"".
 
 ""I wonder if there are other measures that Aboriginal people and communities might look very good against,"" she says.
 
 The main economic target - to boost Indigenous employment - has highlighted deep challenges. The latest figures put the Indigenous employment rate at about 49 per cent compared with about 75 per cent for non-Indigenous Australians. That yawning 26 percentage point gap has hardly moved for a decade. One reason for the lack of progress is that many Indigenous people live in remote areas where jobs are scarce. They face the tough choice between their ""mob or a job"" because the only option for employment is to move a long distance from home.
 
 Biddle says that upheaval can be extremely difficult. ""If someone moves from a remote area to a non-remote area their employment outcomes get worse, at least in the short-term,"" he says.
 
 And the targets omit one fundamental indicator of Indigenous welfare which has been deteriorating: incarceration rates. Research published recently by Labor MP Andrew Leigh found the share of Indigenous adults in prison has more than doubled over the past three decades from 1124 per 100,000 adults in 1990 to 2481 per 100,000 adults in 2018.
 
 Leigh, who is a former economics professor, estimates almost a quarter of Indigenous men born in the 1970s have spent time in jail. His analysis shows Indigenous Australians are more likely to be in jail than African-Americans in the United States, a community in the Western world known for the staggering inequality faced in the justice system. ""Indigenous Australians are now the most incarcerated people on earth,"" he says.
 
 Progress towards Closing the Gap would be even worse if the targets included incarceration rates, but Leigh says they should be added. ""I think we should be tracking Indigenous incarceration because we know the exposure of Indigenous Australians is so high."" .
 
 Rudd disagrees, saying when the process began, his government focused on Calma's advice that health and education inequality was a crucial starting point. He also argues failure to hit the targets does not mean progress has not happened. ""I ask you to consider this, if it were not for the Closing the Gap strategy of the last decade or so ... would we now be on track to achieving our national target of year 12 retention rates?"" he said in his speech.
 
 ""I think not. If it were not for the Closing the Gap strategy would we now be on track for having virtually all Indigenous little ones in preschool? I think not. If it were not for the Closing the Gap strategy would we now be seeing improvements in virtually all the numbers across all the measures of Closing the Gap in literacy, numeracy, health housing and the rest. I would suggest not.
 
 ""Because, notwithstanding the fact progress in five of these seven areas has been patchy and there is still much to be done ... until we focus our national energies around a particular objective, around Closing the Gap, then it doesn't happen."" Rudd said he was wary of politicians from either party seeking to alter the targets because they had not been met, suggesting that they may be seeking to ""crab walk"" from their responsibility to tackle inequality and achieve reconciliation.
 
 Calma still calls for greater Indigenous agency in the process, but a consistency of funding and dedication to the task of Closing the Gap, which he says has varied as governments and heads of departments have changed, would also help.
 
 One observer who was there at the start of the process was a staffer to Rudd, Lockie Harris. ""Good accountability measures tell you truths that are sometimes scary to hear,"" he says. ""The truth this is telling us is that the loss pain and suffering we have caused this group of people over the past 200 years is so deep and so profound that even with the combined will of Parliament we have not even begun to shift the dial.""
 
 Calma says since the apology and the adoption of the Closing the Gap strategy both major parties have worked more co-operatively with one another and with Indigenous groups that have ""dragged governments along"" with them. ""There has been a massive, massive improvement.""
 
 Despite that the gulf in life expectancy and quality continues. Perhaps, he says, it is time to reset to the goals we have failed to meet.",1978
132,Navigating the tensions of the past,Fairfax,2020-05-08T14:05:39.276Z,"Controversy is engulfing Captain James Cook in the 250th year since his landfall at Botany Bay.
 
 As the world reacted to the killing by police of African-American George Floyd, the issues of racism and slavery came to the fore. Statues around the world of Christopher Columbus, Winston Churchill and Edward Colston, among others, were defaced while at home statues of Captain Cook and other ""civic leaders"" were targeted as Black Lives Matter protests gathered momentum.
 
 Who was Captain Cook?
 
 James Cook was born in 1728 in Yorkshire. Apprenticed to a coal shipper in Whitby, he began to learn the skills of navigation.
 
 In 1755 he joined the Royal Navy and steadily advanced. In 1768 he was promoted to commander of the bark Endeavour and sent to Tahiti to observe the transit of Venus. He was also slipped secret instructions by the Admiralty to find the mythical southern continent.
 
 On April 29, 1770, Cook went ashore at Botany Bay and, the National Library states, took formal possession of NSW for Britain. Cook writes in his log that he shot a musket three times at two Aboriginal men. He says the only effect was to make one man lay hold of a shield. Other reports suggest the man was wounded.
 
 Why is Cook in the news?
 
 Cook was always going to be in the news this year, the 250th since he dropped anchor south of Sydney. A circumnavigation of Australia was planned for the replica Endeavour but the COVID-19 pandemic put paid to that. Cook made headlines instead as statues to the navigator were defaced. Last week police in Sydney formed a barrier around the statue in Hyde Park during a Black Lives Matter protest. Then on Sunday police arrested two women after the statue was graffitied. A second 110-year-old statue to Cook in Randwick was daubed with ""no pride in genocide"".
 
 A similar attack took place on a Cook statue at Edinburgh Gardens in Fitzroy North. A cross in white paint was daubed over Cook's face and the word SHAME scrawled below it.
 
 One of two charged in relation to the Hyde Park incident was a part-time worker in NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge's office. A similar thing happened in 2017. Hyde Park Cook was graffitied with ""change the date"".
 
 The protest is not limited to Cook. Statues around the world of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, war-time UK prime minister Winston Churchill, English slave trader Edward Colston, British mining magnate and politician Cecil Rhodes and Belgium's King Leopold II have been targeted in recent weeks as the BLM protests gathered momentum.
 
 So what's the problem and the answer?
 
 There's a clue in the wording on the statue in Randwick. It states Cook was ""the celebrated navigator and discoverer of this territory"", which ignores the fact our First Nations people's settlement occurred 60,000 years, or thereabouts, earlier.
 
 Bill Shorten, Labor leader at the time of the 2017 attacks, suggested additional plaques.
 
 A second plaque along the lines of ""Australia now recognises that Indigenous people were the first settlers of this land"" might be a start. Interpretation of history is always in transition but needs to face facts. Ratification by Parliament of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, or at least a national conversation about it, is the obvious start.
 
 Not much has changed in 50 years since the 200th anniversary. The Sydney Morning Herald reporter Margaret Jones covering the event wrote: ""Black Australia did not forget Captain Cook yesterday. It commemorated the 200th anniversary of his landing with a day of mourning. While thousands of white Australians crowded into the reserve at Kurnell to watch the re-enactment of the Endeavour's arrival, several hundred people gathered at La Perouse, across Botany Bay, for a very different kind of ceremonial. Wreaths thrown into the water by Aboriginal leaders were carried out by the tide, and drifted sadly across the bay towards the landing site.""
 
 Ahead of the 250th anniversary, Sutherland Shire Historical Society published a small book called East Coast Encounters 1770, Reflections on a Cultural Clash. Ten academics and historians bring a contemporary and unique insight to the oft-told story.
 
 In one chapter Mark McKenna, professor of history at the University of Sydney, writes: ""In all the stories that have circled around James Cook since he stepped ashore at Botany Bay in 1770 - the assertions of historical firsts, the discovery narratives, the fierce disputations over Cook's statue and the countless ex post facto claims freighted onto the shoulders of one brilliant navigator from Yorkshire - it is possible to witness a nation hankering for a foundation narrative and its dispossessed people demanding that they be included in that same story on just terms.""",805
133,Need for accountability on robo-debt,Fairfax,2020-06-12T09:55:14.483Z,"Our social security system is meant to be there to keep people safe - to look out for people when they fall on hard times. Robo-debt did exactly the opposite.
 
 This crude, inhumane system of debt recovery relied on automated averaging to calculate people's incomes and charged hundreds of thousands of false debts, based on incorrect assumptions that people had been overpaid social security payments.
 
 Most robo-debt victims were already watching every cent when they were suddenly hit with demands to pay debts, sometimes of thousands and thousands of dollars. There was little recourse to challenge the debts, often because they related to events years prior. Anyone who has experienced the insecurity of casual, low-paid work will tell you how unpredictable their pay is from week to week. Robo-debt brutally ignored this reality and instead derailed lives by instantly accusing people of wrongdoing based on false information without adequate human checks or balances.
 
 Along with many others, we long warned the federal government against this gross abuse of power. After years of advocacy especially by people directly impacted, the federal government has been forced to settle a class action with a $1.2 billion package of compensation and repayments of unlawful debts. The true cost though is insurmountable and has been borne by hundreds of thousands of people on low incomes in the form of irreversible damage to their lives.
 
 On the same day the settlement was announced, the Productivity Commission released its report on mental health, finding a cost to the national economy of more than $200 billion per year. This is, of course, in addition to the unaccountable human cost. It's crucial that this report prompts positive action from government on mental health but it's also vital that the government realises how its policies have inflicted damage. Robo-debt was just one of a number of government policies designed to demonise and punish people who find themselves trying to get by on social security because they do not have paid work. People must meet harsh ""mutual obligation"" requirements under threat of having their payments suspended for minor infractions, such as arriving a couple of minutes late to a meeting or not being able to access a government app.
 
 In some towns, mostly Aboriginal communities, people must use paternalistic cards to pay for their shopping with only limited access to cash. This throws up a raft of practical problems, for example for people share-housing or trying to buy secondhand furniture.
 
 While we did see social security payments increased this year so that people without paid work could finally cover the basics, the increase was only temporary and has already been cut, with another cut announced for Christmas time. The combined result is that people without paid work are forced to live in deep uncertainty and fear. With record high unemployment, it's an experience now being shared by millions of people across the country.
 
 It does not have to be this way - the Morrison government could instantly make major improvements to mental health by dropping the tired, old approach of demonising people without paid work, and by putting in place a decent, permanent social security safety net. Doing so would cost less than the high-end income tax cuts the government has planned.
 
 The government also needs to ensure that the untold suffering of robo-debt is never allowed again. This means transparently holding those responsible to account. To date, there has been almost no accountability or consequences. We should all care how a federal government was able to do this, to so many, and for so long, in the face of repeated warnings. This is why we need an independent, arm's-length inquiry to get to the bottom of this disaster.

134,New Closing the Gap agreement won't deliver,Fairfax,2021-03-24T13:24:50.111Z,"Most Australians, especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, are frustrated with the annual parliamentary ritual of lamenting the lack of progress on closing the gap. The adoption of targets and the tyranny of metrics has not served us well.
 
 The undisputed sheer volume of financial and human effort utilised over the decade to address fundamental disadvantage but delivering only a lack of progress, lack of Aboriginal self-determination and failure to shift the wellbeing of our people is an indictment on the nation.
 
 Last week another new, ostensibly ""historic"" agreement was struck, with four ""priority reform areas"" and 16 new targets. Among them, according to reports, was a ludicrous target on incarceration that set 2093 as the moment we could expect to see Aboriginal people jailed in the same proportional numbers as other Australians. Talk about hoisting the white flag on incarceration. No wonder Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt disavowed it.
 
 A feature the government was happier claiming was that the new National Agreement on Closing the Gap was a deal between it and the Coalition of Peaks, the many organisations that make up our Aboriginal service delivery sector. This innovation is ostensibly ""self-determination"". It is anything but.
 
 The peaks are a triumph and a testament to the activism of pioneers in the health and services sector who lobbied for the same level of services for Aboriginal people as other Australians and for community control of those services. But the peaks are contracted service providers. They rely on government funds to run their organisations and these monies are pegged to the governments' outcomes not ours. Government can defund and dismiss them with a wave of a pen.
 
 In many cases, where Indigenous service deliverers have been forced to move away from community control to Western corporate structures to satisfy the requirements to receive taxpayer money, there is real tension between communities and the corporate boards of these entities.
 
 When we held the community dialogues that produced the Statement from the Heart with its groundbreaking contribution to self-determination, the Voice to Parliament, community members said the peaks did not represent them, even if they purported to. The Coalition of Peaks representatives have said on many occasions that they are not the Voice.
 
 True self-determination is beyond the scope of providers of essential services. We need reform that will give Indigenous Australians some power over all decisions that are made about us.
 
 The peaks treat the symptoms, but a protected Voice in the constitution is about treating the causes of illness, of incarceration, of early death, unemployment and poor education outcomes.
 
 The participants in the regional dialogues said the cause was structure: it was powerlessness in determining their present and their futures and the future of their children and grandchildren.
 
 This role in controlling one's life is true ""self-determination"" and it can't be found in a consultation process led by bureaucracy - even Indigenous bureaucracy. The danger in promoting the new agreement as self-determination is that we are allowing the right to self-determination to be shaped by the government's agenda. Unlike the Uluru dialogues which invited communities to design their futures using the platform of constitutional change, the Coalition of Peaks closing-the-gap process is about refreshing a flawed policy.
 
 This continues a dangerous trend internationally of self-determination being reduced to process rather than handing over power to Indigenous people.
 
 Fundamentally, the government is striking a deal with government contractors who deliver services to Indigenous communities. There remains a power imbalance between the deliverers and the community. This means the agreement is neither radical nor historic, it is the status quo.
 
 Alongside the ludicrous target for incarceration parity by 2093, we learned last week of a Commonwealth target for more Indigenous bureaucracy. My first job as a lawyer was with the Commonwealth, and I support employment initiatives. But combined with the lack of true self-determination, creating more bureaucrats does not bode well for avoiding another decade of annual elegies on not closing the gap.

135,NOW TAKE ACTION ON RACISM,News,2021-10-01T21:20:47.989Z,"BLACK Lives Matter. Of course, they do! Every one’s life matters regardless of colour, age, gender or religion.
 
 When a life ends prematurely, whether by accident, the pandemic, because of any of Australia’s climatic events, violence or by one’s own hand, families, friends, and communities grieve.
 
 The recent events in the United States have sparked a worldwide response. The footage of George Floyd’s arrest and subsequent death were horrifying to watch.
 
 I am sure most Australians are sympathetic to the cause behind the demonstration in Melbourne on Saturday, if not the conduct of the rally when we are trying to minimise the risk of the coronavirus spreading.
 
 The rally had two elements, the loss of Floyd’s life at the hands of a white US policeman. And second, the overrepresentation of indigenous people in our justice system.
 
 While I accept the right of people to attend a mass gathering, I have long asked what do the protests really achieve?
 
 In the case of the protest on Saturday, Australians may have sent a compassionate message to Americans that we oppose brutal force continuing to be used against black Americans. But how in real terms will that lead to a change in culture in America? The civil rights movement in America was a decades-long struggle to end legislated racial discrimination and the movement for equal rights has been a feature of US life almost since its foundation. Along the way civil rights leaders have come and gone, such as Martin Luther King Jr and many others, and still discrimination exists.
 
 So apart from a show of solidarity those who gathered on Saturday probably will not have influenced the law makers in the US one iota.
 
 On the other hand, in Australia the issue of deaths in custody of indigenous men and women is a matter of fact and should be of real concern to us and how Australians can make a difference.
 
 Sadly, in Australia prejudice and acts of discrimination by many continue against our First Peoples.
 
 This is partly historical, because white settlers failed to understand and appreciate indigenous customs and history and imposed a culture and legal system upon our First Peoples. This injustice has been compounded by the media highlighting the problems in the indigenous community — rather than celebrating the many successes — which creates a damaging and negative narrative for our First Peoples.
 
 The sense of “us and them” is further fuelled by resentment among some non-indigenous communities that our First Peoples are having claims to their land upheld by courts around Australia.
 
 Many indigenous people are successful in their chosen fields, doctors, lawyers, educators at the highest levels, artists, sportsmen and women, politicians, and many other disciplines.
 
 But let’s consider a few uncomfortable facts: INDIGENOUS people — 798,365 — make up about 3.3 per cent of the Australian community; THE indigenous community makes up about 28 per cent of Australia’s prison population; and THE recidivism rate among First Peoples is about 70 per cent, compared to 29 per cent for non-indigenous persons.
 
 Does that not indicate a serious issue we all should address? More than 430 Aboriginal people have died in custody since 1991. And sadly, the suicide rate among indigenous men and women is much higher than the rest of the community.
 
 As Australians we need to work hard at removing all forms of discrimination towards our First Peoples. We need to respect and learn more about their culture.
 
 So, to those who gathered on Saturday concerned about issues in the US and in Australia I challenge you to do more than just assemble.
 
 Let us address our challenges of deaths and discrimination here first before we protest with what is happening elsewhere in the world. And let us commit to see real change and not just feet on the pavement.
 
 John Kennedy, former coach at the Hawthorn Football Club and also a respected schoolteacher, was renowned for saying when addressing his players: “DO something, DO. Don’t think, don’t hope, DO.” I challenge those like me who are concerned about the disproportionate number of our indigenous community in the prison system to “do”.
 
 Do something practical to reverse the trends. And I challenge those who have just read the damning statistics above to think about what they represent in terms of inequality in Australia and what needs to change.
 
 Can I suggest everyone joins an organisation that is trying to advance our relationship with our First People. In other words, do something constructive, rather than attend a rally then go home.
 
 Also educate yourself about the work being done to recognise our First Peoples in the Constitution, as well as the standing reference group that allows First Peoples to advise governments on rules and regulations that might affect their community, customs and cultures.
 
 Finally, if joining a movement that salutes our indigenous community is not within your ability, then make a small but regular donation to an organisation which advances the indigenous community.
 
 In short, I challenge those who gathered on Saturday to address some of the real challenges in Australia. When we have succeeded, we can worry about the rest of the world. I challenge you all to do something. Do what will make a positive difference to Australia’s greatest asset. Our history. Our First Peoples.
 
 Then I will march with you.

136,One word makes a difference,News,2021-02-05T15:18:10.710Z,"Our national anthem should draw the nation together Regardless of whether our ancestors have been here for 60,000 years or if they arrived in convict chains or as postwar immigrants, Australians can take pride in our ancient land. The classical civilisations of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome are recent by comparison.
 
 Without indulging the destructive cancel culture, the suggestion by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and others that we change the words “young and free” in the first verse of our national anthem to “one and free” has much to recommend it. Dated from the First Fleet in 1788 we are a young country, and younger still from Federation in 1901. But it is understandable that the word young leaves many Indigenous people, whose roots in Australia date back into the Dreamtime, feeling uncomfortable.
 
 The words of Advance Australia Fair are not set in stone. A small change — a single word — could be made with a minimum of fuss. As Chris Kenny writes, the original lyric “Australia’s sons let us rejoice” has seamlessly given way to “Australians all let us rejoice”.
 
 National symbols matter. They engender pride and patriotism. And “one” is who we are. One nation, one people — Australians — on our very old land, building on the courage and legacies of earlier generations. Such unity is something to sing about. Freeman underlined that oneness in her post-race lap of honour in 2000 when she carried the national and the Aboriginal flags in Sydney, during one of the nation’s proudest and most unforgettable moments. This is a conversation worth having at dinner tables, at barbecues, in classrooms and in the chambers of federal parliament.",288
137,Pathfinder' is treading a fine line,Fairfax,2020-04-09T15:03:43.036Z,"It was a big week for Ken Wyatt. As the only Indigenous voice inside a government attempting to chart a course to reconciliation, he faced more bad news on Aboriginal incarceration rates, anger about black deaths in custody and the destruction of ancient heritage sites, all while the Black Lives Matter debate supercharged calls for reform across the country.
 
 But can Wyatt, the man who described himself as a ""pathfinder"", deliver on the hopes of Australia's First Nations' people to deliver an Indigenous Voice?
 
 Who is he?
 
 The son of a railway worker and a woman from the Stolen Generations who grew up on a mission in Western Australia's south-west, Wyatt shed tears when former prime minister Kevin Rudd delivered the apology to the stolen generations on February 13, 2008.
 
 Growing up he heard the stories his mother and her brothers and sisters shared about life on the missions as children without their parents. In his first speech in Parliament he described putting together the missing pieces of his parents' lives, the experience locked away and not spoken of, through field officers' reports in his mother's native welfare department file.
 
 He started his working life as a teacher and once told Parliament he earned more in his first job out of college than his father just before retirement.
 
 After a career in the public service, where he ran Aboriginal health in both NSW and WA, Wyatt snatched the WA marginal seat of Hasluck from Labor in 2010 and became the first Aboriginal person to be elected to the Australian House of Representatives.
 
 What does he do?
 
 Wyatt was promoted to cabinet as minister for Indigenous Australians after the 2019 election. After his elevation, he would tell stakeholders he had been given the task by Prime Minister Scott Morrison of ""delivering"" for Australia's Indigenous people.
 
 He is leading the effort to give Indigenous Australians a new mechanism for community input into government decision-making, which he said would put them ""at the centre"" of decisions that affect them.
 
 In his maiden speech in 2010, Wyatt described himself as a ""pathfinder"".
 
 ""To me, pathfinders are leaders who shape the future, which is fast, fragile, fashionable and ever-changing,"" he said.
 
 ""As pathfinders, we forge the way forward and we draw the maps and pathways for the future generations of Australians. As pathfinders, we have to commit to, and fight for, change.""
 
 What did he do this week?
 
 As Black Lives Matter protests swept the globe, including in Australia, Wyatt revealed the next incremental step in setting up an Indigenous Voice, with the government's plan to be revealed for public consultation in July.
 
 ""We're confident that the Australian people will be able to have their say on an Indigenous Voice this year,"" he said.
 
 ""We're progressing work and every Australian who wants to have a say will be able to have a say.""
 
 But Wyatt was still facing criticism for postponing the most contentious part of the plan by pushing back a referendum to enshrine the Voice in the constitution. Wyatt has said it was ""too important to fail"" if done in a rush.
 
 In Parliament this week, Wyatt addressed spiralling rates of imprisonment for Australia's Indigenous peoples and said he would be working with the states and territories to set targets to reduce the rate.
 
 This comes after the latest ABS statistics revealed Indigenous people are locked up at 10 times the rate of the general population.
 
 But none of this satisfied some Aboriginal leaders around the country.
 
 Former co-chair of Reconciliation Australia Tom Calma slammed political leaders - including Wyatt - for taking years to reach a national agreement on incarceration rates and Indigenous justice. He said Black Lives Matter protests showed the cost of inaction.
 
 Protesters outside Rio Tinto's Perth headquarters this week called for Wyatt's resignation over the destruction of 46,000-year-old rock shelters in the WA's Pilbara iron ore region to make way for a mine expansion.
 
 They said he and his cousin Ben Wyatt, who is WA's Aboriginal affairs minister, could have done more to stop the blast at Juukan Gorge.
 
 Why is this important?
 
 The Black Lives Matter movement has swept the globe, with its protests and controversies putting a blowtorch to the belly of governments over their handling of historical and present-day racism.
 
 The path Wyatt has tried to find is midway between the conservatism of a number of his colleagues and the demands put upon him by protesters and professional activists.
 
 As the lone Indigenous voice speaking out inside the Morrison government, Wyatt will have to handle the pressure from both sides to deliver for Australia's First Peoples.",799

 My condolences go out to all the victims, families and friends who have been the subject of police brutality or suffered the indignation of witnessing such abhorrent acts. Why is this allowed to continue? How can we change this?
 
 I write this as a former law enforcement officer and veteran of Indian decent. I began my military career in the UK at the age of 18 and suffered racism at the hands of instructors and peers. I then joined the English police service and once again was victim to the same abuse.
 
 Chastised by my diaspora and victimised by some of my colleagues, I was in a special kind of hell. I transferred to Scotland, where I worked in some diverse and beautiful landscapes. In 1998 I was the first ever ethnic police officer in northern Scotland. On their own crime reporting system for the purpose of identifying ethnicity, they used the word ""Negroid."" I sent a memo to Police HQ and the senior leadership team and had to rationalise how this was inappropriate. I knew they had received the memo as I received timely ""feedback"".
 
 Nothing changed. I left the police a short while later due to racism and bullying by a senior officer. Naturally the senior leadership team did nothing to stop the racism and, as per their playbook, closed ranks. My heart goes out to minority colleagues globally who suffered a plethora of other incidents, and the ""good"" officers who serve, protect and risk their lives on a daily basis.
 
 To the people of Scotland, I salute you. In my tenure as an officer both on and off duty, I was treated with respect, compassion and welcomed into the communities I served. It was a pleasure and an honour. Racism is what finally brought me to leave a job I truly loved.
 
 When I think about George Floyd's tragic death, or any of the uncalled-for deaths we hear about in the United States or, of course, here in Australia, it makes me think about what we can do to change things. I can't ever claim to understand the circumstances of either African-American men or Australia's Indigenous people, but from my experience, I wonder whether we could turn around this horrendous track record by changing the make-up of the institutions responsible for these atrocities.
 
 Today, some 30 years after marching in the military, investigating crime, being awarded medals and guarding the royal family and sitting prime ministers, nothing has changed. Yet I still believe in a police service that reflects the community and encourages ethnic minorities to join the police.
 
 Positive discrimination should be an avenue to recruit a wider, socially cohesive service. Recruits should be supported and encouraged through their community and not stigmatised or resisted. Recruitment drives should target these recruits and offer them the protection from racism and bullying. There should be zero tolerance for such behaviour. If you are racist to a colleague, what are you doing to the ethnic minorities on the street, especially with extra judicial powers at your disposal? Selection, training and continued monitoring should be used to weed out racists and bullies.
 
 I encourage the Australian police services to set up a monitoring and evaluation unit, a taskforce, call it want you want, but a wholesale assessment on current activities and future sustainability. A road map that spells out a gold standard and how this journey can strive to reach these goals. The Royal Air Force motto is Per Ardua Ad Astra - ""through adversity to the stars"". Perhaps the taskforce motto could read ""through diversity to the stars"".
 
 There are diversity programs plastered on police websites, but I believe the framework to support and drive them is flimsy at best. Most police forces have found the transformation from a mono-cultural service to multicultural one difficult to achieve.
 
 These obstacles include lack of representation, language, cultural barriers, and a significant lack of trust and fear. On contacting Victoria Police, they could not provide me with any diversity figures. The eradicate institutionalised racism, a police service should reflect the people they are policing in terms of demographics, ethnicity and gender.
 
 We know there is widespread mistrust in the uniform. As a society we need to go back to basics and witness a ""bobby"" walking the beat, community policing should be given a priority, and the police need to be once more approachable and sociable.
 
 I never thought about entering the Police Force when I immigrated to Melbourne a decade and a half ago. I was disappointed to look at the same sea of white faces in uniform, a far cry from the demographics of this great city we live in.
 
 If we don't make the changes, we will quickly find what's happening in America, happening here in Australia.
 
 The time to act was yesterday. We have not, so we must take action today.

139,Prison stems from disadvantage and entrenches it,News,2021-09-21T17:37:42.202Z,"The story of Richmond’s two-time premiership player Marlion Pickett reads like a fairytale. He went from youthful crime and prison time in Western Australia to playing his first AFL game at age 27 in last year’s grand final at a packed MCG and being among the best on th ground. This year, in his 20th AFL game, he won his second premiership medal.
 
 Sadly, Pickett’s story is the exception­ to the rule. Our new report­, Partners in Crime, shows that Australia’s criminal justice systems are far more likely to keep people on the same path than put them on a new, more hopeful one because incarceration creates and compounds multiple forms of disadvantage that are closely entwined with getting in trouble with the law.
 
 A few statistics illustrate the problem. A survey of prisoners shows about a third reported being homeless in the month ­before going to jail, but more than half expected to be homeless when they got out. About half of prison entrants were employed before being locked up, yet less than a quarter had jobs organised on release.
 
 With no work and no home to go to, it is hardly surprising people leaving prison are more likely than not to return to the corrections system within two years.
 
 After doing time, ex-prisoners generally go back to communities that often lack the financial means and social resources to support them adequately. This makes it likely the disadvantage compounds and becomes cyclical, often down the generations.
 
 Almost one in five surveyed prisoners had a parent or carer in prison when they were a child. About 77,000 children were estim­ated to have a parent in prison in 2018. These children are the innocent victims of the criminal justice conveyor belt.
 
 Criminal justice systems have become the default response to disadvantage. In place of getting the support they need, ever more people are locked into cycles of disadvantage, at great cost to human dignity, and damaging not only prisoners but their families and communities. The impact is particularly dev­as­­tating for Indigenous Australians, overrepresented at every stage of our criminal justice­ systems. They experience higher rates of victimisation and police contact, and are the most incarcerated people in the world, as the Uluru Statement from the Heart reminds us.
 
 Before COVID-19 struck, incarceration rates had been rising despite falling crime rates. Most states and territories have incarceration rates above the global average, which is enormously costly to taxpayers. In 2017-18, total net operating expenditure on prisons was $3.4bn, rising to $4bn when community corrections are included. And that does not include the capital costs of building new facilities. In its 2019 budget, Victoria alone announced a record $1.8bn spend to accommodate an extra 1600 prisoners.
 
 On the evidence, no jury would be convinced that more prisons and tougher sentences will make society safer. Recently, some US states have managed to close prisons and reduce crime rates. Proportionally, Germany locks up far fewer people than we do, yet has a lower homicide rate.
 
 We need to find more effective and efficient ways to reduce crime and increase community safety. Prison systems have a role to play. The public demands offenders pay a penalty for breaking the law. Victims of crime legitimately expect­ to see justice done. Yet we also want our systems to reform offenders so they can lead prod­uctive lives. And the best investment would be services that ensure people aren’t sucked into the system in the first place.
 
 Australia’s most vulnerable people are caught up in criminal justice systems that lack a unified purpose, oscillating instead between­ the conflicting aims of punishment, deterrence, restitu­tion and rehabilitation.
 
 We need to make a clearer choice about the purpose of such systems. Holding people in jail is a policy choice, one often driven by community anxiety about crime. But it’s often the wrong choice.
 
 COVID-19 shows us things could be different. A fall in the number of people entering custody demonstrates the possibility of alternatives, of lowering incarceration rates and of crafting a different­ narrative on crime and justice that doesn’t trap us into repeating­, or amplifying, the same failing measures.
 
 This needs co-ordination between employers, industry, civil society, communities, service providers, philanthropy, and people with lived experience. It calls for high-quality evidence and evidence-based decision-making. And it requires hard work at the systems and community levels.

140,Public drunkenness is not a crime,Fairfax,2020-10-01T00:36:19.505Z,"It's nearly midnight. A rowdy group of people who have been drinking heavily tumble out onto the footpath, right in front of you. A few are singing footy songs. Another slumps down and falls asleep. It may be a little disconcerting but if they are not harming anyone, would you call their actions criminal?
 
 In Victoria, you would. Under the Summary Offences Act you can be charged if the police think you are drunk in a public place. It's up to them to judge, based on your speech and behaviour, and if they believe alcohol is the cause.
 
 But the Victorian government is moving to abolish the law against public drunkenness (which can result in a fine of more than $1000). It's brought a furious response from Police Association secretary Wayne Gatt who claims it's ""dangerous virtue signalling"" that will put the safety of the police, the public and those intoxicated at risk.
 
 Then again, in NSW the offence was repealed in 1979, without Sydney descending into violent chaos. So, maybe it's Gatt who's indulging in virtue signalling?
 
 Let's go back to that boisterous crowd on the footpath. What if they are lawyers or bankers staggering out of the Melbourne Club on Collins Street? Or young tradies outside a pub in Broadmeadows? Or Aboriginal people in Fitzroy?
 
 The law covers all people equally, but the police use their discretion to enforce it differently depending on who you are.
 
 It's a vital element of the debate because Aboriginal communities have been at the forefront of the movement to abolish the law because of the discriminatory way in which the laws have been enforced. Research from the Law Institute of Victoria shows that Indigenous Australians make up nearly 30 per cent of all people imprisoned for public order offences such as public drunkenness despite being only 0.8 per cent of the state's population.
 
 The 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended changing the law, so Indigenous Australians are rightly outraged that it's taken 30 years for Victoria to take action. For some, it's a matter of life and death.
 
 Yorta Yorta grandmother Tanya Day was arrested in 2017 for being drunk on a V/Line train. She had fallen asleep. At Castlemaine police station, she fell and hit her head. She died in hospital. The Coroner found that her death was entirely preventable and her treatment affected by an ""unconscious bias"" against her Aboriginality.
 
 Rather than be arrested, what Ms Day needed was what all intoxicated people need. They just want to go somewhere safe like home, a hospital or a sobering-up shelter. The last thing they need is for the police to get involved.
 
 Some people will, quite rightly, wonder if the law is changed then what can be done if, say, a gang of drunk young people starts harassing families at a local park.
 
 But there will still be laws to cover that. Being drunk and behaving in a riotous or disorderly manner is still a crime. Violence that may have been caused by alcohol will still be a crime. And police can also ban people from places where there has been a history of alcohol-related violence.
 
 In other words, police will have full powers to protect the community. What they won't have is the offence of public drunkenness to use as a fall-back against people who aren't really doing anything wrong, and that is almost always used against the poor, the mentally ill, Indigenous Australians and other people who wander on the margins of society.
 
 Nobody is saying that excessive alcohol consumption doesn't bring a range of difficult social problems. But alcohol use and abuse is a public health issue. Shoehorning it into the criminal justice system
 
 has failed.
 
 The abolition of the offence of public drunkenness is an important step in moving the law away from criminalising disadvantage, poverty and mental illness.
 
 Our criminal laws should be an instrument for justice - not injustice. It's time for a rational
 
 and humane approach to a very human problem.

141,Race hustle is powering up,News,2021-10-23T22:18:13.734Z,"The Left-wing racist catchers have been in fine form of late as the Black Lives Matter movement gains traction
 
 ANDREW BOLT sky NEWS
 
 OUR race hustlers have caught another racist! It’s their biggest catch since footballer Adam Goodes called a 13-year-old girl the “face” of “Australian racism”.
 
 And the best bit about catching actor Eliza Scanlen is that it will scare the rest of us into bending the knee.
 
 See, if even Scanlen and her patrons in our film industry are racists, which Australian isn’t?
 
 Scanlen’s film career has been rocketing (Little Women, Sharp Objects), but last week – uh oh – she won the Sydney Film Festival prize for best director of a short film.
 
 Mukbang is her coming-of-age story about a girl caught in an online eating craze popular in Korea.
 
 That’s strike one with the hysterical race hustlers.
 
 This shows “how racist and broken the screen industry is in Australia”, raged Michelle Law, an ethnic-Chinese actor and writer long pampered by the taxpayer-funded SBS, Screen Australia and the Australia Council.
 
 For a start, declared the unappeasable Law, Scanlen’s film was “profoundly problematic in the way it appropriates Korean culture in order for a white girl to find herself”.
 
 Second, Scanlen’s film briefly showed a drawing of a white girl choking a brown boy.
 
 A brown girl choking a white boy would not have worried anyone. But this? Racist!
 
 How could the judges, who included actor Bryan Brown and director George Miller, or the festival’s board, which included an Aboriginal filmmaker, not spot this racism!
 
 To Law, this proved Australia’s institutional racism: “The people I know who have worked on this film and plugged it on social media … are perpetuating a racist system from which they benefit.” Scanlen fell to her knees. The “racist” drawing was edited out of her film, and her producer issued a grovelling self-criticism in their joint names that sounded straight out of Mao’s Cultural Revolution.
 
 “We are absolutely ashamed to have overlooked the issues with the film, and it just proves how insidious, persistent, and deeply in bedded (sic) racism is in Australia, and in us as white Australians.” If only they had hired some People of Colour on the film – like Law? – this “would not have happened”. How often do we now see this same hysterical process?
 
 Step one: a race warrior complains about some supposed racism that even impeccably woke Leftists couldn’t see; Step two: the Leftists cave, too scared of seeming racist themselves; Step three: more race warriors move in.
 
 Take the ABC. For years it’s lectured the rest of us about our supposed racism. It made a fuss about hiring the most out-and-angry People of Colour to show how un-racist they were themselves.
 
 For example, turban-wearing Yassmin Abdel-Magied, who claimed Islam was the most feminist religion, was hired as a presenter. Former Greens candidate Osman Faruqi, who tweeted “it’s time for white people to take a back seat”, was made editor of ABC Life.
 
 But no race-pandering is enough. Faruq still complains the ABC is filled with “white boomers” and “white nationalism constantly features on the ABC”.
 
 Intimidated, whites once hired by the ABC are now dropping to their knees, too, and issuing humiliating self-criticisms.
 
 Comedian Josh Thomas, whose show Please Like Me ran on the ABC, last week said he was “super-ashamed” and a “really dumb, illogical, insensitive idiot” for once saying he’d had trouble hiring experienced actors of colour.
 
 Actor Dan Keough, who’d twice used the “n” word on the ABC to mock racists, confessed he showed a “gross misunderstanding of white privilege and the systemic racism towards people of colour”.
 
 And the ABC, filled with white guilt, is now undertaking a “harm” audit to see what ABC shows it should ban as racist.
 
 Everywhere on the Left, the race hustle is on.
 
 The Age, the most Left-wing paper in the country, last week dumped its editor after staff protested he still hadn’t been sympathetic enough to the Black Lives Matter protests. More than 100 past and present students and staff of the National Institute of Dramatic Art claimed our taxpayer-funded arts school wasn’t, either.
 
 “Your neutrality has been complicit in white supremacist and colonial violence,” they said in a joint letter that accuses NIDA of “systemic and institutionalised racism”.
 
 NIDA, too, fell to its knees, last week, apologising “sincerely” and promising “substantive change”, which the protesters insisted should include getting more students and staff of colour.
 
 How often we’ve seen this hustle in past revolutions.
 
 First the revolutionaries turn on their own, persecuting moderates and terrifying the rest into being more extreme. Then unleashing on everyone else. Watch out for step two.",817
142,Race politics spurs spread,News,2020-06-18T09:05:18.127Z,"Victoria’s ‘crazed’ multicultural policies have helped unleash this tragic, catastrophic second wave of COVID-19
 
 ANDREW BOLT sky NEWS
 
 MULTICULTURAL Victoria is insane. The Premier has said yes to handcuffing protesting grannies in a park, but no to fining Afghans actually spreading the virus.
 
 In an extraordinary press conference on Saturday, Daniel Andrews said his police would not charge the 34 Afghans from five families who’d just got – and spread – the virus by breaking social distancing rules.
 
 Their information was too good: “The value of the information that allows you to take one test result and then find the 33 other people who’ve got it, is much more than $1652.” Outside, meanwhile, Andrews’ police again showed no such mercy to non-Afghans posing a health threat to no one.
 
 Once again, they chased away women protesting in sunny parks, gang-tackled and handcuffed a man at the beach, and told an old woman to not stop for breath on her walk.
 
 Of course, this isn’t the first time Andrews has been nailed for ideological-driven hypocrisy.
 
 He still struggles to explain why police did not fine a single one of the 10,000 people at a Black Lives Matter protest, but did handcuff a mum in her pyjamas for posting on Facebook about a protest against Andrews’ police state.
 
 But Saturday’s press conference was different. It didn’t just expose how much race politics is corrupting Victoria’s fight against the virus, but how desperately the government tries to hide that fact.
 
 That was clear from the apology issued by Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton. No, he didn’t say sorry for the bungling that let the virus out of quarantine hotels and into aged care homes, killing hundreds. Sutton instead said sorry for telling the truth about some people responsible for a fresh Melbourne outbreak last week.
 
 “Wabekhai,” Sutton said to Afghans in Pashto.
 
 “Mazerat mikhayom,” Sutton said to Afghans in Farsi.
 
 Sorry, for having revealed that those five families were Afghans and “singling them out”.
 
 But don’t Victorians deserve to know something about the people who break basic social distancing rules and endanger the rest of us?
 
 True, many people spreading the infection are actually born-here Australians, but it is also true that most seem to be immigrants – perhaps poorer, less trusting, harder to reach.
 
 This second wave of infections started with guards in quarantine hotels, mostly immigrants, and then spread in heavily multicultural suburbs and workplaces.
 
 The government complained that issued health warnings in 53 languages didn’t seem to be enough, and even today the Melbourne suburb with most new infections has twice as many immigrants than the average. That already showed that turning Australia into a nation of tribes makes us less safe.
 
 Now we’re also learning how much Andrews’ multicultural policies helped to unleash the virus. Here are some examples: ANDREWS’ government gave a $44m contract for hotel quarantine security to Unified Security, which wasn’t a preferred tenderer but did claim to be “Indigenous owned”. More than 90 per cent of second-wave infections came from a hotel Unified was hired to make secure.
 
 UNIFIED got the job “in keeping with the State government’s procurement objective of utilising Aboriginal businesses”, said the public servant responsible, even though its owner has a white complexion, and few – if any – of the casuals then hired were Aboriginal.
 
 A CO-ORDINATOR of Victoria’s response said many security staff at the two hotels from which the virus escaped had cultural and “language barriers”.
 
 YOUR Nursing Agency, which supplied nurses to quarantine hotels, said guards told it “they were concerned about using hand sanitiser because it is against their religion”.
 
 BOTH co-ordinators of the disaster response warned that using police or soldiers instead of private security could intimidate people in quarantine – often dual nationals returning from India and the Middle East.
 
 A PUBLIC servant at the hotels told an inquiry he’d got an hour of training in “equity and diversity”, but none on protective equipment.
 
 ADS for senior staff for the government’s COVID-19 Forward Strategy and Co-ordination Branch had four paragraphs of job description stressing a commitment to diversity, but not one stressing a commitment to stopping infections. They declared: “We encourage job applications from … people from culturally diverse backgrounds”.
 
 So: diversity above competence. Afghan virus-spreaders not punished, while white social media posters are handcuffed in their homes. And the chief health officer apologising only if he’s caught telling the truth. More than 700 people have died not simply from the virus. Many were killed by the most crazed multicultural policies in Australia.",788
143,Reopening schools a milestone,News,2021-06-04T16:36:35.793Z,"The move will boost growth, jobs and students’ learning
 
 The return of about four million students to their classrooms in all states and territories is a vital step in Australia’s return to full strength, as the COVID-19 pandemic eases. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, who previously had announced schools would remain closed for the rest of this term, had no alternative on Tuesday but to announce a resumption of classroom teaching from May 26. Victoria is last cab off the rank and anything else would have been a further breach of the advice of health experts. Students are back already in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia, and some are back in Queensland and NSW. Remaining out of step with the rest of Australia would have undermined Victoria’s recovery. It also would have hurt students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds for whom home learning has been problematic. For most, digital technology has been a lifeline, which was not the case during the US polio epidemic last century when research showed school closures damaged young people’s prospects. For returning students, the first half of this year is a time they will not forget.
 
 Schools reopening should boost communities’ morale as part of what Scott Morrison describes as getting out from under the doona. It will add nearly $2.2bn to the economy, Josh Frydenberg told parliament on Tuesday. A week ago, Treasury analysis presented to the national cabinet showed classroom closures had led to more than 300,000 job losses and sliced 3 per cent from gross domestic product. Those losses, arguably, were avoidable. From the outset of the coronavirus crisis, the Prime Minister, armed with the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, has been consistent in maintaining that schools should be open. COVID-19, as Mr Morrison noted, has a very low rate of transmission between children.
 
 State and territory leaders and teachers’ unions have been more cautious, especially Mr Andrews. Most parents, bombarded with conflicting advice, played it safe and kept their children at home. But as the economy opens up, the gradual return of classes, to be completed within a couple of weeks, will free parents to concentrate on their jobs at home, to return to their workplaces as conditions allow and, in some cases, to look for work as economic activity gathers pace.
 
 In terms of learning, Education Minister Dan Tehan says the evidence is clear that nearly half of Australian children and young people are at risk of adverse effects on their educational outcomes by being physically disconnected from school. If online delivery were to continue for much longer, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, those with complex learning needs, those with disabilities and indigenous students would lose valuable ground in numeracy and reading. These are the essential building blocks of further educational attainment and an important determinant of students’ job prospects.Given the disparate assessment and tertiary entrance systems across the nation, most states and territories are adjusting coursework for the rest of the year to give Year 12 students certainty after weeks of disruption. Mr Tehan, keen to encourage private schools to reopen, offered financial incentives for them to do so. And a network of Victorian private schools, in a challenge to Mr Andrews, demanded the discretion to reopen in regions largely unaffected by COVID-19. Now the confusion is over. New clusters of the virus here and overseas are a reminder of the need for caution. The measures outlined by Mr Andrews — staggered drop-off systems and breaks, physical distancing for adults and extra cleaning — are good precautions. And the COVIDSafe app will help alert communities of any outbreaks.",616
144,Rio cops fallout of caves error,News,2021-12-14T10:30:46.632Z,"A balance must be struck between mining and social issues The London-based board of mining giant Rio Tinto has taken the only viable course in demanding three executives accept personal responsibility to defuse an escalating row over the destruction of an Aboriginal heritage site in Western Australia. Ever since the detonator was plunged in May to blow up a site with evidence of 46,000 years of human habitation, the Juukan Gorge caves debacle has been a textbook case of how not to manage a crisis.
 
 It is also a cautionary tale for all business of how unrelenting lobby groups have worked their way through funds managers to become a potent force to monitor and police a smorgasbord of social justice issues. The bottom line is the Rio board had a tin ear in dealing with the uproar caused by the destruction of the caves. This damaged the company’s relations in WA and will cause further grief for Australia’s mining community more broadly. Having made the fundamental error in blowing up the cave against pleas to save it, the company failed to make management accountable.
 
 For Rio, offering the scalps of chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques , iron ore boss Chris Salisbury and corporate affairs chief Simone Niven is the first step on a long road to restoring good social licence. Like all miners, Rio Tinto has been working hard to get on to the right side of an increasingly demanding investment community. Investment funds, with billions of dollars under management, are themselves responding to new pressures that capital be better aligned with socially progressive ideals. This is reflected in the introduction of onerous reporting provisions on climate change action, diversity and environmental performance. Big miners have always been at the forefront of shifts in corporate behaviour in Indigenous relations, workplace reform and foreign investment.
 
 When Rio began its WA journey in the early 1960s through local subsidiary Conzinc Riotinto of Australia, iron ore entrepreneur Lang Hancock was an enthusiastic supporter of using nuclear bombs to transform the Pilbara. The Gorton government gave cautious support to plans to explode nuclear charges but backed down following pressure from environmentalists. Hancock’s plan was to blast an inland harbour, flatten ranges to enable better rail access and blast billions of tonnes of iron ore to be left as a reserve for years to come. At that time, cultural heritage was at the end of the list of concerns. Few supported the nuclear option then and fewer still would today. But it shows how much things have changed.
 
 Rio has mapped out a transition plan. Mr Salisbury will step down from running Rio’s iron ore division with immediate effect, Ms Niven will complete “an orderly transition of her responsibilities” and Mr Jacques will remain until a successor is appointed. Pension funds have emerged as kingmakers or executioners. New Future Fund boss Raphael Arndt said the fund’s attention to sustainable investment meant Juukan Gorge “is exactly the sort of issue we are focused on”. Superannuation fund Hesta, which manages $52bn on behalf of more than 850,000 Australian workers, has warned Rio’s conduct posed a risk for the entire mining sector. The Church of England pension fund added a moral dimension to the criticism of Rio. Rio had argued that legal approval for the destruction of the caves was given by the Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee in December 2013 after it considered a host of factors including an absence of “specific ethnographic stories” relating to the area. It proceeded with the destruction against more recent objections from traditional owners after withholding alternative mine plans at the time of the initial approval because blowing up the caves would unlock an additional $135m in ore. It is possible to object to Rio’s handling of the Juukan Gorge issue but still be concerned about what the full cost of a more assertive investment community with a social justice agenda might be. Aboriginal interests, and those of the wider community, have not always been best served when pressure groups have used Indigenous concerns to block development and push their own ideals.",696
145,Stop taking away Indigenous kids,Others,2021-10-07T00:52:05.139Z,"""Proportionally, we are the most incarcerated people on the planet. We are not an innately criminal people. Our children are aliened from their families at unprecedented rates. This cannot be because we have no love for them. And our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers. They should be our hope for the future.""
 
 - the Uluru Statement from the Heart Aboriginal children in out-of-home care are punished for behaviour other kids get away with on a daily basis.
 
 There is one way we can stop Aboriginal deaths in custody. Governments already know what they can do to make the change. But they don't.
 
 We must stop stealing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families.
 
 We said sorry to the Stolen Generation, sorry to the families whose babies were removed from their love and care.
 
 That was 10 years ago.
 
 But we weren't really sorry. We are still inflicting untold harm on Aboriginal children, who are being removed from their families at a furious rate, greater than during the Stolen Generation.
 
 When I first wrote about this in 2014, there were 14,000 children removed. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare figures show 15,455 children in out-of-home care in 2015 and 17,979 last year, an increase of 16 per cent over four years, an increase in the number of children torn from their families.
 
 Around one third of them have no daily contact with Aboriginal community or kin.
 
 These children are meant to be under the protection of the state, but what happens next shows the state does not care. Children who are placed in out-of-home care are hugely overrepresented in the criminal justice system.
 
 We can stop this. And we must.
 
 Antoinette Braybrook, the chief executive of family violence prevention and intervention service Djirra, has called on state and federal governments to rethink this industrialised criminalisation of Aboriginal children.
 
 As chair of the National Family Violence Prevention and Legal Services Forum, she is demanding that instead of stealing children, protection services work to support families.
 
 What happens now is that child protection services are notified of a concern and the children are then removed.
 
 What should happen is that on notification, the families should be flooded with support.
 
 How hard can that be? How hard can it be to surround those in need with useful tools to combat disadvantage and circumstance?
 
 It's well-documented that most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are in adult prisons come from the child protection system. They are caught up in the injustice factory from early on.
 
 ""Child protection involvement creates a pathway through to adult incarceration. It's a vicious cycle of institutionalisation of our people,"" Braybrook says.
 
 Three years ago, the Australian Law Reform Commission delivered the report Pathways to Justice - An Inquiry into the Incarceration Rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples.
 
 t noted the link between out-of-home care and incarceration, and said that incarcerations rates of adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples could not be properly addressed without a national review of child protection and the state and territory laws that see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children placed into out-of-home care.
 
 It's the link. It's the thing governments could do to stop deaths in custody, or at least diminish the occurrence. I doubt whether re-education camps for police will do much. Surely there is already investment in training for those in the justice system, yet we still have endless deaths in custody.
 
 Kath McFarlane, adjunct associate professor at UNSW's Kirby Institute, finished her PhD five years ago. It analysed the data linking out-of-home care and incarceration. The results were terrifying.
 
 What she calls ""care-criminalisation"" has been acknowledged and confirmed in a series of government and independent reports, including the 2017 Royal Commission into the Detention and Protection of Children in the Northern Territory; the 2018 Queensland Family and Child Commission's report The criminalisation of Children living in out-of-home care in Queensland and many others, including Family is Culture from the Independent Review of Aboriginal children in OOHC chaired by Megan Davis.
 
 What is care-criminalisation? It's what happens when a kid is placed into out-of-home care: the increased surveillance, the monitoring and policing, the heightened punishment.
 
 An Aboriginal kid who is in out-of-home care experiences punishments and higher levels of justice involvement for the kinds of behavior that non-Aboriginal kids get away with on a daily basis. The bad language. The talking back. Anger.
 
 I'm not wanting to trivialise bad behavior - but it is completely unjust to treat children in care one way and kids living with their own families another way. Because once justice systems get involved, that's when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids end up in jail, or dead.
 
 McFarlane says Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are 10 times more likely to be in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.
 
 Paul Gray, an Associate Professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Jumbunna Institute, says Australia can improve outcomes by supporting and funding Aboriginal community-controlled prevention, family supports and healing, as well as early education and care, including interrupting the pathway from out-of-home care to involvement with the justice system.
 
 ""These actions need to be led by Aboriginal communities. It's definitely long past time for governments to listen to Aboriginal voices and commit to making real change in this area,"" he says.
 
 Aboriginal community-controlled organisations are crucial to making change, yet the federal government has moved to limit those voices.
 
 Last year, it axed the funding for the National Family Violence Prevention and Legal Services, the peak body of services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander survivors of family violence - of which Antoinette Braybrook is chair.
 
 She says there's been a six-month reprieve before funding ends. That funding should only end when the horrors facing Aboriginal mothers and their children end.
 
 That could take a long time, given the longstanding lack of commitment.

147,The Advertiser Sign of the times,News,2021-11-09T03:23:50.092Z,"THE disappearance of Coon cheese from Australian supermarket shelves is a testament to the influence of global campaigns to shed historical names and monuments that can be considered offensive.
 
 Not long before it was learned Coon’s Canadian owners would retire the controversial brand name, Washington’s NFL team announced it would ditch the Redskins moniker.
 
 The team representing the US capital will now be known as the Washington Football Club, at least for the 2020 season, until a new name is chosen.
 
 Multinational conglomerate Saputo revealed the decision to abandon the Coon brand in a letter to Indigenous activist and businessman Dr Stephen Hagan, who has lobbied for more than 20 years to change the name of the cheese. His persistence is admirable and, doubtless, heartfelt. Rightly or wrongly, his view will not be universally shared.
 
 Coon cheese took its name in 1926 from product creator American Edward William Coon – though this version has been challenged.

148,The gaping hole that widens the gap: housing,Fairfax,2020-05-15T17:07:11.771Z,"After 12 years of prime ministers' Closing the Gap reports, the findings have become depressingly predictable. This year we learned that, while the targets relating to Aboriginal children in early childhood education and young people with Year 12 or equivalent are on track, none of the others are.
 
 But there was one glaring omission from the Prime Minister's Closing the Gap speech this week. Housing did not rate a mention. Not a word about action on Aboriginal housing or homelessness.
 
 Housing was not even one of the targets, let alone one we were meeting, but it must be if we are to have any chance of finally closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians on all the other targets for life expectancy, child mortality, education and jobs.
 
 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 3 per cent of Australia's population but 20 per cent of the nation's homeless. Aboriginal people are 2.3 times more likely to experience rental stress and seven times more likely to live in over-crowded conditions than other Australians.
 
 The impacts are particularly felt by our young people. About a quarter of Aboriginal people accessing homelessness services were children under 10 and more than half are under 25.
 
 Without safe, affordable and culturally appropriate housing, efforts to improve health, employment and education for Indigenous people will be futile.
 
 Overall, there is a social housing supply gap for Aboriginal families in NSW alone of 11,000 dwellings, which will rise to over 30,000 dwellings by 2031.
 
 Housing is also a key determinant of health, education and safety. Poor housing and poor housing circumstances negatively affect the physical and mental health and wellbeing of Aboriginal people. Kids need a safe and stable home in which to study, and their parents struggle to secure and hold down a job without the same.
 
 To his credit, the Prime Minister has shown leadership in supporting a changed approach.
 
 As he said, these partnerships are years overdue. But our frustrations with the lack of both federal and state government action on housing over many decades has led NSW Aboriginal Land Council to establish its own housing capability. Our aim is to provide high-quality and culturally appropriate housing and related services to tackle the causes of homelessness.
 
 Without secure homes for Indigenous people, their other targets will not be met.

149,"The law betrays the lore, so we'll destroy it again",Fairfax,2020-08-30T10:20:48.587Z,"The federal government has shrugged off the duty of saving our ancient heritage, write Deb Wilkinson and Peter Burnett.
 
 The government-approved destruction of the Juukan Gorge shelters in the Pilbara is symptomatic of the problems with Australia's heritage laws. They are carefully crafted in favour of development interests. The laws typically protect sites that face no threat from development while offering only process to those that do.
 
 Without change, important heritage sites - Indigenous and otherwise - will continue to be lost.
 
 Western Australia's Indigenous heritage laws rank among the nation's worst. They require development interests to ask permission to destroy registered sites. However, approvals are granted as a matter of routine. This is what occurred with the Juukan shelters. Despite containing artefacts evidencing almost 50,000 years of occupation, they were approved for destruction before comprehensive archaeological surveys had been undertaken.
 
 Yet the federal government could have intervened through two laws: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Both contain emergency provisions.
 
 Rather than using these powers to stop Rio Tinto, the federal Environment Minister was an idle bystander. This was no surprise to those who know how our heritage regimes operate. A little history is needed to explain why.
 
 The post-World War II economic boom resulted in the loss of a substantial number of heritage sites. Responding to rising public concern, in 1973, the Whitlam government established an inquiry to investigate what the Commonwealth could do to protect the nation's heritage. It recommended the creation of an Australian Heritage Commission, which would maintain a Register of the National Estate to protect places of natural, cultural and Indigenous significance.
 
 This was taken a further step forward in 1984, when the Hawke government passed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. Although intended only as a stopgap measure, the act gave the federal government powers to intervene when the states failed to protect Indigenous sites.
 
 Things changed in the early 2000s. Tired of clashing with the states and territories over heritage issues, the Commonwealth retreated from the field. In 2003, the Howard government abolished the Australian Heritage Commission and neutered the Register of the National Estate. In its place came the Australian Heritage Council and a new National Heritage list. On paper, the list was an advance as places on it received substantive protection. In practice, it was the beginning of the end.
 
 Under the new legislation, control of what was listed on the National Heritage List was vested in the minister rather than the council. The minister could refuse to list places on any grounds. To this day, the minister even controls what the council can assess.
 
 The politicisation of listings has meant the National Heritage List is largely decorative - in most cases, it protects sites that face no development threats. Sites that need federal protection are left unlisted and their fate then rests on deficient state regimes.
 
 The ATSIHP Act remains on the statute book and could act as a federal law of last resort. However, since 2001, governments have treated it as dead law, fending off applications for its use. Ideally, the federal regime would be reformed.
 
 But this is unlikely - where there was once bipartisan agreement on the need for federal leadership, there is now bipartisan agreement on federal indifference.
 
 This leadership vacuum can be filled by cultural institutions and universities. They can serve this leadership role by, among other things, working with Indigenous communities to set standards for the protection and management of Indigenous heritage sites.
 
 As Reconciliation Australia has done, they could also cut ties with Rio Tinto and other developers who desecrate heritage sites, including by shedding their directors and executives from their boards.

150,The time for a new future is here,Others,2021-10-18T16:13:58.911Z,"Australia's existing institutional arrangements and policies have failed to deliver a fair go to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.
 
 The time has come to do things differently.
 
 That is why Greenpeace has formally accepted the generous open invitation contained in the Uluru Statement From the Heart, to walk forward together as part of a movement of the Australian people for a better future.
 
 When I read the Uluru statement I am struck by the poetic gravitas of the language and by the generosity of the political offering.
 
 The statement speaks across the great spaces of our continent, presenting this invitation to every Australian:
 
 ""We leave base camp and start our trek across this vast country. We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.""
 
 The historical gravity of the proposition is immense; despite all that has happened in our country the prospect is there for us to come together in a more just commonwealth.
 
 And what the statement also outlines is a pragmatic pathway to getting there: the creation of a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament; a historic process of truth telling and then the overdue process of Makaratta - agreement making among the peoples of Australia.
 
 The vision of the Uluru statement creates an opening for all Australians to participate in an ideal of greater justice. We all get that bit bigger in a more just Australia.
 
 As Professor Megan Davis has said ""the Uluru Statement was purposefully issued to the people, and not to politicians for a reason"" because it is we who hold the power to unlock the constitution.
 
 Ultimately it is within the power of the people of Australia to deliver on the promise of our nation.
 
 The need for the kind of approach outlined in the Uluru statement is plain.
 
 Our current political system does not give fair or effective voice to First Nations Peoples.
 
 The consequence is that laws and regulations are made about Indigenous people, with scant regard to their rights, opinions, expertise - or the internal sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander polities.
 
 The result is a cycle of injustice, dissatisfaction - and ineffective policy making.
 
 Meanwhile, the emancipative ambition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders is often frustrated by decision-makers who are deaf to reasonable demands and the wisdom of lived experience.
 
 As a nation, we are knotted up by the legacy of our colonial past, lacking the institutional means to weave a tapestry for a more just and equitable society in the future.
 
 Prior to Greenpeace I worked as a native title lawyer and I witnessed first-hand the bewilderment and frustration of my clients.
 
 Unpacking the legacy of colonisation and invasion and doing the work of shared nation building was not served by electoral cycles.
 
 Even the best intended ministers were hamstrung by the lack of stable footings for the necessary work.
 
 It is 15 years since the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission was abolished by prime minister John Howard - pre-empting even his own government's review into the effectiveness of that body.
 
 The government-appointed National Indigenous Council set up in 2004 lasted just four years.
 
 The National Congress of Australia's First Peoples was set up independent of government in 2009, but was starved of funding and went into voluntary administration in 2019.
 
 Constitutional recognition as put forward in the Statement of the Heart is essential to end the tragic merry-go-round of national Indigenous representation being wilfully destroyed or starved of the ability to operate.
 
 The Voice to Parliament would enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have a genuine say in the creation of the laws, policies and programs that impact upon their rights.
 
 The shift in our nation's institutional arrangements offered by the the Uluru Statement contains the seeds for a transformation in how all of us Australians care for our beautiful shared country, creating new opportunities for the expression of the interdependence of indigenous rights and ecological values.
 
 There are profound implications for our environment and for the existential challenge of the climate emergency.
 
 Greenpeace's mission is to secure a world capable of nurturing life in all of its magnificent diversity - a vision can only be achieved with a more fair and just world, putting people and nature at the heart of decision-making.
 
 It is a point that Thomas Mayor, a Torres Strait Islander man born on Larrakia country, and a tireless advocate for the Uluru Statement made strongly when he noted that the Statement From the Heart is ""important for the climate change struggle too"".
 
 And as Mayor wryly observed that ""I think if Indigenous people had a voice in decision-making a long time ago, I don't think we would have been so reckless with how we treat the environment.""
 
 Already in Australia there have been conspicuous successes, including Indigenous protected areas, joint management of national parks and the Indigenous ranger program. A flourishing environment is ultimately a precondition for the recognition of Indigenous rights, and for all humanity. The risks to Indigenous societies from environmental degradation, whether from the destruction of nature, industrial farming, pollution and severe climate damage, are starkly apparent.
 
 The twinning of Australia's rapid transformation to clean energy with renewed determination to salve the legacy of colonisation and invasion are central to the future for all of us who live in this magnificent southern continent.
 
 Truly, the time has come.

151,TIDE TURNS ON WAVE OF ALCOHOL-BASED ABUSE WHEN ACCESS IS RESTRICTED,News,2021-06-21T02:47:51.348Z,"We need to find the right balance between human rights and individual responsibility As a paediatrician who has studied and worked in the Kimberley, Pilbara and Northern Territory for the past 20 years, now specialising in foetal alcohol spectrum disorder within the justice system, I have observed the impact of the “rivers of grog” on multiple generations of remote Australian families.
 
 If there were a recurring theme among my clients — and there is — it is a pregnancy relatively young, stressed by overcrowded housing, discordant family dynamics, domestic unrest, maternal stress and worry (not adequately diagnosed nor managed). There is also self-medication with alcohol, marijuana and, more recently, amphetamines; a child born early, small, or both, and an infancy with inadequate access to food, the foundations of learning, or healthcare. This isn’t an Aboriginal problem, it is a problem of human circumstance, demography and bad luck. When I sit opposite a young Aboriginal man in Banksia Hill Detention Centre in Perth, Broome Regional Prison, or Don Dale Detention Centre in Darwin, I reassure him that had I had the same start to life as he, it would be me sitting in the drab olive tracksuit. And if he had the same start to life as I, he would be wearing the stethoscope. The influence of our early years on our life course is substantial.
 
 The human backdrop to this malady is most often a family and community bound together by shared hardship and intergenerational trauma, pride of culture and love of kin and country. It’s complicated, to say the least. At the centre of this is alcohol, used to recreate, medicate and decimate.
 
 Contemplating alcohol restrictions on a community or regional level is complex and impacts at many levels. Some families run businesses that rely on sales of alcohol; some individuals derive social benefits or relief through its use; some use it in moderation with no ill-effect. Some use it in ways that tear their lives apart, or causes permanent damage to their bodies and minds, or perhaps most tragically, causes lifelong damage to the brains of unborn children.
 
 My opinion is that I support vigorous policy approaches to reduce access to alcohol in circumstances where the data indicates that it is causing net social harm. My approach is a balance of human rights (particularly those of children) and individual responsibility. Government involvement and policy serves to create an environment in which individuals, families and communities can make better choices. Restricting access to alcohol reduces the background rates of consumption as a social norm, and with this lowering tide go the highest-risk drinkers.
 
 Strategies that work include increasing the price of a standard drink of alcohol (ideally to at least $1); reducing opening times of takeaway outlets; sensibly reducing the number of licensed outlets; reducing the amount and strength of alcohol that an individual can purchase in a day; designating and enforcing dry households or communities; curbs on inappropriate promotion; and banning individuals from purchasing alcohol if they have alcohol-related domestic, criminal or mental health issues.
 
 Full participation of families in these initiatives, and adequate opportunity and resourcing to support their alternative use of time, and adequate social and emotional wellbeing and mental health support programs are essential. Every time I have seen these policy approaches evaluated, there has been a reduction in the severity of domestic violence, less alcohol-related police and hospital emergency department activity, an increase in per capita spending on food and clothing, less litter, and better community spirit. As June Oscar noted with the alcohol restrictions implemented in Fitzroy Crossing in 2007, they “provide a circuit-breaker to a community in crisis and allow them breathing space to rebuild a healthier society”.
 
 There can also be negative effects from restrictions, such as the shifting of problem drinking to other towns, an illegal market in alcohol, or sly-grogging, removing the convenience of drinking for those who do so responsibly, and the use of other substances to fill the void. However, the health and social benefits of the restrictions outweigh any such adverse impacts, and the net effect is positive, as it will be if a suite of policy measures are implemented universally across the north-west.
 
 In Fitzroy Crossing the courage of local leadership to implement restrictions has shifted the most important indicator of social health that I have come across – rates of drinking in pregnancy.
 
 In 2002, before the restrictions on sale of full-strength alcohol from takeaway outlets, 55 per cent of women in the Fitzroy Valley drank in pregnancy, almost all at high-risk levels.
 
 In 2017 our best data indicate that less than 20 per cent of women drank in pregnancy and at greatly reduced risk levels. I cannot think of a stronger case for implementing broad restrictions on alcohol access than that.James Fitzpatrick is a medical doctor and director of PATCHES Paediatrics.",833
152,Time to heed cry for justice,Fairfax,2021-10-08T22:49:49.563Z,"These are hard times. Times when it feels like we are forced to choose sides. Times when race matters and I wish it didn't. I wish we could stand for justice above race. But justice can't be colour-blind, because injustice was never colour-blind.
 
 When I look at America torn apart after the death of another black man killed at the hands of police, I see people who look like the people in my family. I see people with a history of racism that I share. I am a world away, but bonded in struggle.
 
 As a boy, raised in an Aboriginal family, in politics and the church I looked to the giants of America's civil rights struggle: black pastors such as Ralph Abernathy, Jesse Jackson and of course Martin Luther King jnr, men who believed that character should matter more than colour.
 
 But for black people, has America ever truly been the land of the free?
 
 This week I have thought of the words of the African-American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates: ""In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body - it is heritage.""
 
 Coates wrote his seminal book Between the World and Me after one of his friends was shot dead by a policeman. In an open letter, Coates warns his young son that ""the police departments of your country have been endowed with the authority to destroy your body"".
 
 Sometimes Coates' words seem too bleak, yet this week they sound like prophesy to black Americans. This week, George Floyd is every black person in America who has died under a whip, been lynched from a tree, or perished in a building set on fire by racists in white hoods.
 
 This week Americans hear the great James Baldwin: ""To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.""
 
 I have felt that rage here.
 
 I felt it when I saw the boys of Don Dale bound and hooded and beaten and tear-gassed. I feel that rage when I recall the stories of my own family's past: of segregation, discrimination and police beatings.
 
 I feel that rage when I think of how Indigenous people are the most incarcerated in our country. And how they die still in police cells: 432 black deaths in custody since the royal commission 29 years ago.
 
 We should all be angry because when our country fails its people, we all fail.
 
 Yes, Australia has been good for me but too many of our people cannot say the same. Too many are lost to early graves, locked in endless cycles of poverty and misery. This is the torment of our powerlessness; we know it is broken and still we fail to fix it.
 
 This is the legacy of our history: those wounds of the soul that don't heal and can so easily turn toxic.
 
 History hangs so heavy in our world - on the streets of America, across the Middle East, in the borderlands of Europe and behind the wall of China.
 
 These are treacherous fault lines. From the grievance of history we construct our identity, and identity at its worst can be a terrible thing. Identity can pit us against each other; we form our tribes and we tear each other apart.
 
 The Indian philosopher and economist Amartya Sen was right: ""identity can kill - and kill with abandon"".
 
 How I wish we did not have to choose sides. How I wish we could slip the yoke of history. How I wish this was not about race. But this week, it is hard to not see race when race is all we see. When people who have been branded by race seek the solidarity of race.
 
 Dr King's dream seems so far away.
 
 Yet the violence can blind us to those people black and white marching together peacefully, those who still cling to what the greatest American president, Abraham Lincoln, called the better angels of our nature.
 
 Democracy should be big enough to hold us all - regardless of colour or creed. And that's the struggle of our age when around the world democracy is in retreat and authoritarianism is on the march.
 
 That great beacon of liberty, that nation that promised to take in the poor and sick and huddled masses, the America of dreams, is ablaze, unable to police itself, let alone the world.
 
 It is sad to see and we are all poorer for it.
 
 As we look to America, as people here march in solidarity with the best of America, we can save ourselves from the worst of America.
 
 This is a moment to ask if our country can fulfil its promise. Can our great country be great for all? These are just words. Actions are so much harder and, judged by our actions, history tells us we have failed.
 
 But history need not define us. We are not America; our streets, thankfully, are not battlegrounds. Here, the cry of justice need not be an invitation to hate.

153,"To close this shameful chasm, PM, first you'll need to hear our Voice",Fairfax,2020-12-20T13:57:39.171Z,"The government cannot hope to close the gap for Indigenous Australians until it truly listens to what they need, writes Thomas Mayor.
 
 Woe and behold, imagine you are an Indigenous person observing the annual Closing the Gap speech. Before you is a rich, powerful man who does not fall under the constitution's race power as you do. Rather, he wields his power with the Parliament he stands in. He stands to speak, telling you how much he desires to do different next year — how he will listen. But you've heard it before. He has failed, and you fear he will fail again. Believe me, it doesn't feel good.
 
 After all, the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is immense, and for 12 years of the same rhetoric, very little has changed. Again, there is as much regression as there is progress. The adult Indigenous population is barely 2 per cent of the total population, yet we are 27 per cent of the prison population. We are not an innately criminal people.
 
 Our children still die at twice the rate of non-Indigenous children. This cannot be because we have no love for them. A quarter of their deaths are by suicide. They should be our hope for the future.
 
 I didn't sense that Prime Minister Scott Morrison, as he delivered his speech yesterday, felt the torment of our powerlessness. Perhaps it's because this speech to the Parliament has become a ritual. Perhaps it is as simple as the fact he is not Indigenous, and therefore it is not his kin he is speaking of.
 
 I felt a disconnect in the speech. Like the Closing the Gap report, it was full of glossed-over realities a world away from the real suffering that comes with those shameful statistics that define Australia's relationship with its First Peoples.
 
 But hang on. Am I being too critical? Morrison said we must do better. He said he supports a Voice. He respects our ""honest yearn for constitutional recognition"". But has he really heard? I am a signatory of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. I can tell you, he has only heard what he wants to hear.
 
 As an elected representative from the Darwin regional constitutional dialogue in May 2017, I was a part of an unprecedented process in this country. More than 1300 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from all points of the southern sky poured our collective experiences and perspectives into a consensus at the most spiritual place on the continent — Uluru. From the heart of the nation, we called for the establishment of a First Nations Voice enshrined in the constitution. Not a legislated Voice to the government and a separate referendum on symbolic constitutional recognition, as the Morrison administration proposes.
 
 Let me say it again for my people.Indigenous people are not interested in a symbolic form of constitutional recognition. This will be as useless as a Closing the Gap speech. We need the power to hold the operatives of Parliament accountable. Indigenous people don't want an act of Parliament to merely legislate the Voice. From the Australian Aboriginal Progressive Association in the 1920s through to the First Peoples Congress more recently, the fate of Indigenous political organisations has been the same. Hostile governments destroy any Indigenous voice that speaks with authority. We want to go that vital step further - make it the rule that we are heard, not by the grace of indifferent politicians.
 
 A Voice to government? Where the hell has this come from? We have had many voices to government. With decorum we have met government people, always behind closed doors. Our many voices to many different governments and their ever-interchanging representatives have failed. A constitutional Voice to the Parliament is different. We want Indigenous perspectives in the centre of decision-making, no longer on
 
 the fringes.
 
 In the same week the Prime Minister has said he is listening, the leaked terms of reference for the advisory group on the government's model for a Voice, appointed by the Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has exposed that - more than not wanting to listen - the government has muzzled the group. It has been restricted from supporting constitutional enshrinement of the model.
 
 Actions speak louder than words in a Closing the Gap speech. Repression of Indigenous voices has led to the statistics in the report. If Scott Morrison is serious about closing the gap, he will lift those restrictions and listen. If the advisory group wants to be true to the people its decisions will affect, it will accurately report what we say.
 
 It is time Morrison heard and felt what we called for at Uluru. Indigenous people want him to accept the invitation to walk with us, as so many Australians have already done without his leadership.

154,Tradition can take us forward,Fairfax,2020-02-15T11:38:56.362Z,"Indigenous learning and kinship systems could help shape our future in a post-COVID world.
 
 As a proud Kaytetye woman caught between many worlds, I have drawn on the traditional ways of my people to cope with the new realities of COVID-19. This First Nations knowledge has lessons for all Australians. It can shape the future in a post-COVID society.
 
 We have the opportunity to emerge on the other side of this crisis in a way that better provides for community wellbeing, intergenerational learning and sustainability. We will all benefit from 80,000 years of ancestral knowledge by Indigenising our future.
 
 Any parent who dealt with homeschooling these past weeks has, in fact, been re-engaging in traditional ways of learning. Family units have become core learning spaces, where parents and carers have assumed the role of teachers. This is a resurgence of learning systems as old as time, from which most have unfortunately been disconnected. But First Nations communities have long been teaching young people across a knitted frame of educators in a lifelong learning process, where each person within a community has a role to play in educating a young person.
 
 It is a rich and resilient tapestry, not relying on any one resource or one system but shared across grandparents, aunties, uncles, community members and specific knowledge custodians. Community-centred learning that crosses both education systems at school and home within a family or community context provides a holistic space for the ongoing education of our young people and has been showcased during this time.
 
 Likewise many Australians are re-evaluating their connection to physical space. During the crisis, in which many people have been confined to their homes, we have seen significant growth in people's connection to place and a shift towards sustainable living through locally sourced food and staying near home.
 
 First Nations people have always had strong connections to the natural environment. We look after Country so it looks after us, working as land managers with an inextricable link to the ecosystems we exist within. Each individual is connected to a particular place they are responsible for looking after. Cultivating the land and eating seasonally has always been central to our existence. With coronavirus creating volatility in food supply chains, people have shifted to locally sourced and seasonally grown produce. The depleted supply of seedlings and herbs at your local nursery is an example of the strong upward trend of home gardening, a commitment to working to cultivate the land and live sustainability.
 
 In the same way we are being forced to redefine our relationship with space, so are we re-evaluating our concepts of time. Across Australia, First Nations ways of existing within non-linear time have become more prominent through the pandemic, with many of people embracing a slower pace of life, deeply engaging with themselves and spending more time ""being"" rather than ""doing"".
 
 In First Nations cultures we talk of ""creation time"" and ""ancestors time"" - melding the past, present and future in a deep space of reflection. Our languages don't have words to describe ""non-linear"" because no one has ever thought of life and time in straight lines. Our old people are constantly telling our young people to slow down and be connected with ourselves, our ancestors and the world around us, which is paramount for taking time to reflect, and observe how the world is shifting.
 
 The lockdown has allowed me to slow down, to reframe my relationship with time and to focus on connecting with the past, present and future.
 
 This helps us reprioritise. For many that has meant an outpouring of help and support for one another and society's most vulnerable.
 
 First Nations kinship systems have always worked to ensure every member of a community has obligations to one another and each individual is looked out for, no matter what.
 
 Initiatives like ""adopt a healthcare worker"" are evidence Australians are looking out for one another with a type of support beyond normal reciprocal friendships.
 
 The past months of social isolation have highlighted ways in which the world has rapidly shifted its systems to protect our communities. It has proved unprecedented change is possible in a short time frame and under great strain. Looking forward, we have the opportunity to embrace the emergence of knowledge systems shared by First Nations communities since time immemorial.

155,Traditional ways can take us forward,Fairfax,2020-12-29T15:41:37.779Z,"As a proud Kaytetye woman caught between many worlds, I have drawn on the traditional ways of my people to cope with the new realities of COVID-19. This First Nations knowledge has lessons for all Australians. It can shape the future in a post-COVID society.
 
 We have the opportunity to emerge from this crisis in a way that better provides for community wellbeing, intergenerational learning and sustainability. We will all benefit from 80,000 years of ancestral knowledge by Indigenising our future.
 
 Any parent who dealt with homeschooling these past weeks has, in fact, been re-engaging in traditional ways of learning. Family units have become core learning spaces, where parents and carers have assumed the role of teachers. This is a resurgence of learning systems as old as time, from which most have unfortunately been disconnected. But First Nations communities have long been teaching young people across a knitted frame of educators in a lifelong learning process, where each person within a community has a role to play in educating a young person.
 
 It is a rich and resilient tapestry, not relying on any one resource or one system but shared across grandparents, aunties, uncles, community members and specific knowledge custodians. Community-centred learning that crosses both education systems at school and home within a family or community context provides a holistic space for the ongoing education of our young people and has been showcased during this time.
 
 Likewise many Australians are re-evaluating their connection to physical space. During the crisis, in which many people have been confined to their homes, we have seen significant growth in people's connection to place and a shift towards sustainable living through locally sourced food and staying near home. First Nations people have always had strong connections to the natural environment. We look after Country so it looks after us, working as land managers with an inextricable link to the ecosystems we exist within. Each individual is connected to a particular place they are responsible for looking after. Cultivating the land and eating seasonally has always been central to our existence.
 
 In the same way we are being forced to redefine our relationship with space, so are we re-evaluating our concepts of time. Across Australia, First Nations ways of existing within non-linear time have become more prominent through the pandemic, with many of people embracing a slower pace of life, deeply engaging with themselves and spending more time ""being"" rather than ""doing"".
 
 In First Nations cultures we talk of ""creation time"" and ""ancestors time"" - melding the past, present and future in a deep space of reflection. Our languages don't have words to describe ""non-linear"" because no one has ever thought of life and time in straight lines. Our old people are constantly telling our young people to slow down and be connected with ourselves, our ancestors and the world around us, which is paramount for taking time to reflect, and observe how the world is shifting.
 
 These months of social isolation has highlighted ways in which the world has rapidly shifted its systems to protect our communities. It has proved unprecedented change is possible in a short time frame and under great strain. Looking forward, we have the opportunity to embrace the emergence of knowledge systems shared by First Nations communities since time immemorial. This work can begin now: this week is National Reconciliation Week, a moment for all Australians to reflect on First Nations' contribution to our national fabric. As the world looks to create sustainable economies, improve learning systems and enhance community wellbeing, we can see that First Nations communities already hold many of the answers we are looking for.

156,TRUTH IS KEPT LOCKED UP,News,2020-02-23T14:59:38.981Z,"TUESDAY’S Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney was stopped by police before it started, yet still worked its poison.
 
 That’s because it was a cliffhanger story for weeks — will it go ahead in this pandemic? — and the media gave its organisers a huge platform.
 
 Boy, did they use it to spread their toxic story that police and prison guards were racists, murdering Aborigines who shouldn’t even be in jail.
 
 The main organiser, Paddy Gibson, appeared on Channel 10’s The Project this week to claim — unchallenged — that we “continue to incarcerate 10-year-old Aboriginal children” and “torture” them.
 
 He went on: “Particularly in the case of David Dungay ... Charge the guards that killed David Dungay Jr!” Dungay’s name is now everywhere in the media. As The Guardian Australia said, “Dungay’s 2015 death in custody has become a symbol of the Australian Black Lives Matter movement” because this poor “26-year-old Dunghutti man died after five guards rushed his cell to stop him eating biscuits”.
 
 The media left kept repeating this line — guards killed an Aborigine just for eating biscuits — which helped to damn what three academics in the taxpayer-funded Conversation this week called our “racialised policing and custodial practices” and “discriminatory over-policing” of Aborigines.
 
 Here is the Sydney Morning Herald: “Dungay died inside the prison hospital complex in 2015 when guards stormed his cell because he refused to stop eating a packet of biscuits.” SBS: “Prison staff ordered him to stop eating biscuits. When he refused, guards ... held him down.” The ABC: “Dungay died … after five guards restrained him and gave him a powerful sedative.” But all these reports left out three important facts that make Dungay a symbol not of the racism of our legal system, but of the race-baiting of the modern left.
 
 First, none told you anything about this Paddy Gibson that they treated as an authority on our treatment of Aborigines.
 
 In fact, he’s an activist from the Marxist Solidarity movement who’s tweeted that police are “pigs” and his “whole life is dedicated to campaigning against Australian values”, which he defined as “genocide, apartheid, imperialism (and) white supremacy”.
 
 He once described the Russian Revolution — which imposed a murderous tyranny — as “one of the most profound acts of human liberation in history”.
 
 Then there’s a second thing those reports didn’t mention: the reason Dungay was in jail.
 
 Dungay already had a lengthy criminal record, including robberies with violence and a weapon, before he was jailed for the attempted rape of his girlfriend, just 16.
 
 He’d tried to sodomise her, then beat her with a broomstick, chased her with a brick and punched her in the head.
 
 Dungay was also jailed over an armed robbery. He and three mates broke into a house, where they found a 61-year-old man, his sick wife and his 91-year-old mother-in-law. They bashed and stabbed the man so badly that he needed 27 stitches.
 
 Why do many journalists omit this background? It doesn’t justify Dungay’s death, but does show he wasn’t jailed just because of “over policing” or racist police.
 
 Finally, to the most important fact missing from those reports. No, Dungay was not killed by racist guards just for eating biscuits.
 
 He had chronic schizophrenia, was acutely psychotic, and had bad diabetes. His blood sugar level had been tested and was at dangerous levels.
 
 So when he was spotted eating biscuits, he had to be stopped. But Dungay wouldn’t stop, got agitated and fought the warders, so they held him down while a nurse sedated him. It’s all on video.
 
 Tragically, Dungay died, but the coroner ruled no one was to blame: he’d been an unhealthy man whose heart gave out in the stress and struggle.
 
 As the coroner put it: Dungay has comorbidities “which predisposed him to the risk of cardiac arrhythmia such as longstanding poorly controlled type I diabetes, hyperglycaemia, prescription of antipsychotic medication ... elevated body mass index, a degree of likely hypoxaemia caused by prone restraint, and extreme stress and agitation as a result of the events”.
 
 So this is the real “symbol of the Black Lives Matter movement”: a violent thief and woman beater who dies in a struggle with warders trying to stop him eating himself to death.
 
 This the case that Black Lives Matter claims shows our police and warders are racists who kill Aborigines just for eating biscuits.
 
 Yet almost no journalists challenged that smear. Nor did the Prime Minister or NSW Premier.
 
 The protest was stopped but the protesters won.

157,TWIGGY DESCRIBES AN AUSTRALIA WE DON’T KNOW,News,2020-01-12T17:26:43.020Z,"Racism is rife across Asia but we are nothing like some of our neighbours
 
 Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest may be the most Australian person he knows, but he doesn’t know his countrymen and women very well if he thinks Australia is about to “split down the middle” and succumb to “racism and violence”.
 
 In an interview with SBS the Perth billionaire expressed his fears of a racist conflagration in a “manner similar to what’s transpired in other countries”. Although he failed to name these countries I presume he has in mind Indonesia, a nation that since independence in 1945 has subjected its Chinese population to discriminatory laws, expulsions and mass violence. Or perhaps Japan, one of the world’s last remaining monocultures.
 
 Racism, in fact, is rife in our corner of the world. Australia, in contrast to most of its northern neighbours, is a model of multiculturalism, openness, ethnic and religious diversity, tolerance and democratic stability. That’s not to say racism doesn’t exist in Australia. The condition of our Aboriginal population remains an abiding source of collective shame. And the pandemic does seem to have fuelled a small number of assaults, both physical and verbal, on people of Asian appearance. That, of course, is reprehensible. But it’s a profound misreading of the present state of Australian society to see it as somehow on a similar trajectory to countries in our region beset by deep racial fissures.
 
 Racism has brought about the near ruin of Sri Lanka and Myanmar. In Malaysia, a country ruled for more than two decades by the unapologetically anti-Semitic Mahathir Mohamed, social policies are specifically designed to entrench the privilege of one ethnic group: indigenous Malays. And in India, where the “idea of India” championed by Mahatma Gandhi is one of multiple religious and ethnic identities, violence against ethnic and religious minorities is common.
 
 Recently an evening newspaper in the southern Indian city of Mysore ran an editorial, since retracted, directed at the country’s Muslim minority. “The nation is currently hosting an annoying 18 per cent of its population self-identifying as rotten apples,” it read. “An ideal solution to the problem created by bad apples is to get rid of them.” Then there is China itself, where a 10km-square urban enclave in the boom city of Guangzhou is known locally as “chocolate city”. McDonald’s in Guangzhou was forced to apologise in mid-April when it put up a notice in English that read: “We’ve been informed that from now on black people are not allowed to enter the restaurant.” The ban was an expression of – not the exception to – popular sentiment. “This is China, not Nigeria,” trumpeted China’s microblogging site, Weibo. Nigeria’s Foreign Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, felt compelled to issue a formal complaint.
 
 The prevalence of racism in the Asia-Pacific doesn’t excuse racism within our borders, but it should help to shape a response to the problem. The first step is to acknowledge that racism, though morally repugnant to most contemporary people, has deep behavioural roots and is hard to eradicate.
 
 A dog, to most others of its species, is a dog. But humans have a long history, extending through prehistory and flourishing under the Reich, of regarding fellow humans as sub human.
 
 One of Western culture’s great stains is the marriage of racism and imperialism, an unholy alliance that led to the widespread enslavement and exploitation of millions of people in Africa, Asia, South America and the Pacific. But then, paradoxically, one of our culture’s great contributions to moral progress has been the forging of intellectual and imaginative tools to engage with racism and suppress it.
 
 An inclusive humanist ideal is aired in the Hebrew Bible, where God commands his chosen people to treat all as one before the law: “The sentence you pass shall be the same whether it be on native or on stranger.” The Apostle Paul took this injunction and gave it a radical edge: “There are no more distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, but all of you are one in Jesus Christ.” Many centuries later Christianity fired abolitionist William Wilberforce in his ultimately successful campaign to end slavery in the British empire. The poison of racism also has its antidote in the secular intellectual tradition. German-American moral philosopher Hannah Arendt thought that the Homeric poems, which invite us to picture Trojans and Greeks (Achaeans) as equally heroic and equally noble, planted the seeds of humanist universality. “This had happened nowhere before; no other civilisation, however splendid, had been able to look with equal eyes upon friend and foe, upon success and defeat,” she wrote.
 
 In Chapter 19 of Voltaire’s Candide, the hero meets a negro slave who tells him: “When we work at the sugar-canes, and the mill snatches hold of a finger, they cut off the hand; and when we attempt to run away, they cut off the leg; both cases have happened to me. This is the price at which you eat sugar in Europe.” Touche!
 
 Similar bigotry-busters are also found in the Eastern intellectual tradition, particularly Buddhism, with its ideal of compassion for “all suffering beings”.
 
 Of course, no one civilisation possesses a monopoly on the virtues of liberty. Observes Nobel laureate Amartya Sen: “Support for ideas of liberty and public discussion, and what may be called basic human rights, have been articulated no less often in Asia – in India, China, Japan and in various other countries in East, Southeast, South and West Asia – than in Europe.” One response to the pandemic the world over has been a rise in globalism, humanism and a deep appreciation of the universality of suffering. Contrary to this spirit we’ve certainly seen a spike in xenophobia, racism, tribalism. The two instincts – one open, the other closed – are diametrically opposed. And they are at war. The victor will most likely shape the world order for the next few decades.How do we ensure the former prevails? Certainly not by fearmongering of the kind rolled out by Forrest, which has a slightly intimidatory air: keep mouthing off about China and you know what will happen! If we can listen to our better angels, maintain sober leadership, and encourage consensus around some core principles within our own tradition, I think we’ve got this. Twiggy, in the meantime, should reach for his own chill pills.",1087
158,U.S. BURNS BUT WE JUST TURN AWAY,News,2021-02-12T21:29:02.906Z,"Indigenous Australians are jailed at more than twice the rate of African-Americans As many cities across the US burn following the killing of George Floyd, and with protesters demanding changes to deeply entrenched racism within that country’s criminal justice system, Australian politicians should consider themselves on notice: we have even worse levels of discrimination in our system.
 
 The riots across the US, while sparked by the gruesome, filmed killing of an African-American by a white police officer, relate to far deeper and more profound problems with the treatment of black Americans. Discrimination against black Americans extends to all aspects of law enforcement.
 
 Research has established that police are more inclined to arrest suspects from racial minorities than they are white suspects. In the US between 1980 and 2007, black people were arrested on drug charges at rates between 2.8 to 5.5 higher than white people relative to their respective populations, even though they have similar levels of drug use.
 
 Studies also have found that prosecutors are likelier to file and proceed with charges against black rather than white suspects, including where their criminal records are identical.
 
 The most obvious distortion in the US criminal justice system regarding the mistreatment of African-Americans relates to the manner in which they are punished. Sentencing is always the sharp end of criminal law and it is where the state acts in its most coercive manner against individuals. And it is here that the disproportionate suffering of African-Americans is most manifest.
 
 The US has the highest imprisonment rate on Earth, and by an extreme margin. The US imprisons almost two million of its people.
 
 Forty per cent of these are African-Americans, even though they make up 13 per cent of the population. The number imprisoned and the rate of black imprisonment are so striking and so disturbing that it has been suggested there may be an explanation in a presumption of danger and criminality once attached to enslaved African-Americans. Their rate of incarceration has dropped during the past few years — while Donald Trump has been President — but the need to reduce it further remains one of the most pressing objectives of black America.
 
 The rioting by protesters across more than 40 cities in the US is as unjustifiable as it is unfortunate — violence never solves anything — but the killing of Floyd was merely the flashpoint for the expression of a sense of entrenched injustice and persecution felt by so many Americans.
 
 But the US is not alone in maintaining a criminal justice system that operates unfairly against disadvantaged sections of society. As I noted on this page in January, one in 50 indigenous Australians is in prison. This is about 13 times more than for all other Australians.
 
 Many Australians watching the US riots on the evening news may be surprised to learn that we imprison indigenous Australians at more than double the rate that African-Americans are jailed in the US. And it is getting worse.
 
 The imprisonment rate of indigenous Australians has grown markedly since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody a quarter of a century ago recommended that indigenous people should be sent to prison as a last resort.
 
 The grossly disproportionate number of Aborigines in Australian prisons is a national tragedy and a severe blight on our nation’s human rights record. More disturbing is that governments across the country refuse to implement measures to remedy the situation.
 
 I can’t see that this situation would be tolerated in any other modern democracy. Future generations will wonder how and why we failed to address the issue.
 
 The answer, at least in part, stems from the fact indigenous Australians are only a small portion of the total population — about 2 per cent. As a result, they have less political capital than other groups. Their voices are too often and too easily drowned out. By contrast, Maori, for example, comprise about 15 per cent of the New Zealand population and their imprisonment rate, like that of African-Americans, is less than half that of indigenous Australians.
 
 The fact indigenous Australians are such a numerically small portion of the community should not be used to overlook the grotesque unfairness that is inflicted on them by the criminal justice system. Indeed, their voicelessness should cast an even greater burden on all Australians — in particular politicians — immediately to address this suffering in their community.
 
 As it stands, activist groups make more noise for, and governments are more inclined to spend money and resources on, protecting unusual frogs and birds than dealing with our most pressing human rights issue. That indigenous Australians are not rioting in the streets is no reason for moral complacency. The burden of unfair institutionalised punishment we inflict on disadvantaged Australians is every bit as great as the situation we are watching unfold in the US.

159,Vincent Namatjira's win is a great Archibald story,Fairfax,2021-09-09T20:31:53.712Z,"This week the art world basked in the black brilliance of the Aboriginal artists who shone in the Archibald and Wynne prizes at the Art Gallery of NSW.
 
 Four of the five available prizes across the Archibald and Wynne prizes, among the country's longest-running and most prestigious, have been taken out by Aboriginal artists. Wongutha-Yamatji actor Meyne Wyatt became the first Aboriginal person to be awarded the Packing Room Prize, Western Aranda painter Hubert Pareroultja claimed the Wynne Prize and Anangu (Pitjantjatjara) artist Nyunmiti Burton secured the Roberts Family Prize.
 
 The crowning achievement, though, was Vincent Namatjira's Archibald Prize win for his painting Stand strong for who you are, making him the first Aboriginal person to capture the prize in its 99-year history.
 
 Vincent Namatjira's win is a great Archibald story, as his journey as an artist has travelled in parallel with the prize. Some may even say the Archibald is in his blood. Inspired by the 1956 Archibald Prize-winning portrait of his great-grandfather Albert Namatjira by Sir William Dargie, Vincent began investigating his Aboriginal and family histories through portraiture.
 
 In 2014 he painted a portrait of himself with the painting of the famous forebear he never had the chance to know as an entry to the prize. It was not accepted as a finalist then, but today hangs in the Queensland Art Gallery alongside the original. Undeterred, Namatjira has continued to target the prize and has exhibited as a finalist for four consecutive years from 2017-2020.
 
 It's this tenacity and commitment, along with a trademark wit and insight, that has won Vincent many admirers over the past decade.
 
 His style - untrained, raw and personal - has also drawn detractors who demand greater pictorial realism over narrative content (style over substance), with many armchair experts deriding his success over the past few days since the award was announced.
 
 His subject matter now seems an especially appropriate match - a meeting with AFL legend Adam Goodes, who was bullied from the game after standing up to racism. Here, both men, black, determined, and successful, ""stand strong for who they are"", speaking their truths despite the boos of many, upset that their aesthetic or social status quo has been disrupted.
 
 As much as this year's Archibald prize has been a celebration of the vitality of Aboriginal art, it has also been a symbol of power, with Indigenous artists and people ""standing tall for who they are""' beginning to break down the last remaining barriers in the industry.
 
 Against this backdrop, it comes as no surprise that this year the Art Gallery of NSW appointed, for the first time in its 149-year history, an Aboriginal person to its 11-member board of trustees, who also act as the selection committee for the award.
 
 There is a growing understanding that our place in this industry as First Nations people is everywhere - from a gallery's walls to its boardroom, from the desert to the Domain - our presence, voices, histories and stories are the lifeblood of this nation's art and cultural being. Although this year we've witnessed the first Aboriginal artist winning the coveted prize, it certainly won't be the last.
 
 As for Vincent Namatjira, the star of this year's show, long may his subversive, witty and empowering portraits shine, as he turns his illuminating light on our stories throughout history to the present day.

160,We know what needs to be done,Fairfax,2021-07-30T18:49:36.057Z,"The message remains the same: Indigenous people must be given control over what concerns them.
 
 There is no denying the nationwide protests on Saturday, leveraging off Black Lives Matter and the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in the US, reflect a growing sentiment in Australia about Indigenous affairs.
 
 There is something in the zeitgeist when tens of thousands of Australians descend on the streets to march for Aboriginal justice while the nation is transitioning out of a lockdown.
 
 One of the perennial challenges of protest is how to translate it into substantive and durable change. I remember marching as a young person through the streets of Brisbane protesting against Aboriginal deaths in custody and calling for the implementation of the royal commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody's recommendations. It has been almost 30 years since the royal commission and my nieces and nephews were marching on Saturday through the same streets of Brisbane. Yet we know what needs to be done.
 
 The royal commission was set up in October 1987 following national outrage about the number of Aboriginal deaths in custody. It investigated 99 deaths that occurred between January 1, 1980 and May 31, 1989, in prisons, police stations or juvenile detention institutions. A key finding was that the deaths in custody investigated were not the product of deliberate violence or brutality of police or prison officers but that there was a lack of regard for the duty of care owed to people in custody by police officers and prison officers.
 
 The commission made many recommendations but one of its primary reforms centred on the structural powerlessness that renders Indigenous voices silent in a liberal democracy. The commission singled out the importance of Indigenous participation in decision-making to transform Aboriginal affairs, and the right to self-determination. It found that the government had the power to transform the picture of Aboriginal affairs, ""not so much by 'doing' things - more by letting go of the controls; letting Aboriginal people make the decisions which government now pretends they do make"". At the heart of the findings was that Indigenous peoples should have a say in the decisions made about them.
 
 Sound familiar? It should. The Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017 said the same thing. In 2017, the Uluru Statement from the Heart was issued to the Australian people as an invitation to walk with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in a movement of the Australian people for a better future. The Uluru Statement decided upon a consensus reform agenda aimed at fixing the same structural problems the royal commission highlighted 30 years ago.
 
 Thirty years on, the Uluru Statement singles out the same crisis in public policy, incarceration, youth detention and child removals. The systemic injustice operates along a continuum: ""Proportionally, we are the most incarcerated people on the planet. We are not an innately criminal people. Our children are alienated from their families at unprecedented rates. This cannot be because we have no love for them. And our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers. They should be our hope for the future.""
 
 The royal commission said at the time of its work that ""it is difficult for non-Aboriginal people to comprehend just how absolute the domination of Aboriginal people has been"". This is precisely what the Referendum Council heard in the dialogues in 2017 about how the Commonwealth bureaucracy dominates in communities and exerts stifling control.
 
 In 2020, after a decade of a comprehensive closing-the-gap framework through COAG, the evidence is incontrovertible: the bureaucracy cannot close the gap in disadvantage. Thirty years ago, the royal commission predicted this. The resolution of the ""Aboriginal problem"" was beyond the capacity of non-Aboriginal policy makers and bureaucrats. The report was very blunt: ""It is about time they left the stage to those who collectively know the problems at national and local levels; they know the solutions because they live with the problems.""
 
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison knows this already. This is precisely what he did during the pandemic, he left it to the Aboriginal community-controlled health sector to shut down their own communities. And it worked.
 
 That so many Australians turned up in solidarity with Indigenous Australians this weekend accords with research that found Australians want them to get a fair go. Seventy-one per cent agree that Indigenous Australians are best placed to decide matters that affect them. Saturday was no mere protest, my friends; in the words of the Uluru Statement, it was a movement of the Australian people for a better future. And the Australian people are ready for real change.

161,WE NEED TO TURN OUR RESEARCH EYES TOWARD HOME MUCH MORE OFTEN,News,2020-06-27T12:54:51.772Z,"A deeper understanding of our past will help break this cycle of antagonism
 
 Australia Day is a day to celebrate who we are and what makes our country great. It is also a day to acknowledge our history.
 
 For Australians to successfully navigate our future we must better understand our past.
 
 We need fewer people telling us what to think. Instead we need more knowledge and information to help us understand our past for ourselves. Knowledge of our history will help us break the cycle of Australia Day antagonism.
 
 Reconciliation will not come from ignorance. For all Australians to move forward together we must understand who we are, where we have come from and the events that have shaped us.
 
 This will create increased pride in our Australian indigenous history, better knowledge of our British heritage and a greater understanding of the success of our multicultural endeavour. It will help bind us rather than break us.
 
 A successful nation should celebrate, develop and critique its ­society, history and culture, and understand its geography, music, arts, literature and politics. We should be proud that our taxes are funding cutting-edge research in this pursuit.
 
 However, as Education Minister, I have become increasingly concerned that our research is preferencing the foreign at the expense of the Australian. In some cases I worry Australian taxpayers are funding research projects into exotic international topics at the expense of studies into our country and our people. This is in part driven by the method for ranking our universities.
 
 One of the key ways universities receive global recognition is from the quality and quantity of academic papers published in ­respected international journals.
 
 This incentivises Australian academics to study topics with a global flavour likely to appeal to an international editor. As a result, ­ inquiry into uniquely Australian topics suffers.
 
 When Australia as a field of ­research is viewed as a second-class topic it makes the subject less attractive to talented academics, which in turn means there are fewer teachers, students and universities interested in the field. It’s a downward spiral.
 
 Between 2011 and 2020, just 3 per cent of grants under our primary competitive grant scheme — the Australian Research Council’s Discovery Grants — were in the areas of Australian society, history or culture.
 
 If we don’t take an interest in understanding Australia we can’t expect the rest of the world to. For example, Australian indigenous history, like the extraordinary aquaculture that occurred at Budj Bim, has not been given the full ­attention it so richly deserves and the fathers of our Constitution, who helped bring us together as a nation, continue to slip from our national consciousness.
 
 The Australian taxpayer is providing record funding over the next four years for academic ­research through the ARC. This research is high-quality and innovative but we must ensure we continue to mould it for the benefit of the Australian community.
 
 It is why on Monday I am announcing the government is backing the importance of research into Australian society, history and culture by setting aside $12m in ARC grant money exclusively for this purpose.
 
 This will fund about 40 projects in the range of $20,000 to $100,000 each year for up to three years.
 
 Applications for grants open next month with funding starting from October. Grants will still be decided through a competitive peer-reviewed process in accordance with international best practice.
 
 This Special Research Initiative will encourage academics to pursue research into Australian society, history, culture, literature, art, music, politics and geography.
 
 It will cover all aspects, from our ancient Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander beginnings to modern-day Australia, covering community, institutions, urban, regional and rural history and ­cultures.
 
 We don’t fund research to serve the interests of individual academics, we fund research to generate new knowledge that serves our country.
 
 It will reward academics with an interest in Australia, and incentivise more inquiry into the topic.
 
 We all will benefit from more research, more diversity of views, more debate and more new knowledge about Australia.
 
 I want to strengthen the connection between what happens at our universities and the communities that support them.
 
 Our government is working with the sector to protect academic freedom, guarantee freedom of speech and freedom from foreign interference on campus.
 
 We are working to promote our academic research and to explain its benefits to Australians.
 
 From discussions with the relevant faculties, I expect this initiative will fall on fertile ground at our universities.
 
 Teaching Australian students to know more about our society, history and culture should be a priority for all Australian universities.Dan Tehan is the federal Minister for Education.",793
162,What it will take to make Black Lives Matter,Fairfax,2021-08-03T17:19:41.842Z,"The Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Australia three weeks ago highlighted widespread community concern about racism against Indigenous Australians. While the nation's health authorities and some politicians opposed holding the protests during the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems they have not directly led to spreading new infections.
 
 While some controversy over the protests lingers, all sides should agree that they will be pointless unless they result in some concrete changes to the treatment of Indigenous people in Australia. Changes are needed in health, education, policing and justice to end the systematic disadvantage suffered by Indigenous people. While the protests were an immediate reaction to the death of George Floyd in the United States, direct comparisons with African-Americans are fraught. We should focus on the issues facing our fellow Australians.
 
 This will require long-term commitment, funding and an attention to detail rather than just a day of protest.
 
 The Herald has recently highlighted two reforms of the sort that will be needed to effect change. In one, Justice NSW has finalised a business case for a program that addresses one of the most urgent problems: the appalling rate of incarceration of Indigenous people in NSW. The number of Indigenous people in jail jumped 25 per cent from 2013 to 2016 and, in NSW, Indigenous people are 2.8 per cent of the total population but represent approximately 24 per cent of the prison population.
 
  Justice NSW has proposed an alternative to the District Court, known as a Walama Court, which would reduce the number of Indigenous people who receive custodial sentences. It would involve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elders in sentencing discussions with the judge and also during the rehabilitation and monitoring phase.
 
 A business case developed by the District Court estimates that while the new court would cost about $19 million over the next five years, it could save about $22 million on reduced prison beds and lower recidivism. Most importantly, it would change the lives of many young Indigenous men and women and allow them to remain with their communities.
 
 The other reform the Herald has covered is at a much higher level and would change Closing the Gap, the joint state and federal strategy to end Indigenous disadvantage. After a progress report in 2018 showed minimal advancement on the key markers assessed each year, Prime Minister Scott Morrison endorsed giving Indigenous people a stronger
 
 say in how the program's targets are set and what is done to reach them.
 
 A report by the Council of Peaks, a group that brings together peak Indigenous representative organisations, has now surveyed Indigenous groups on what that might involve. It found 91 per cent of respondents backed giving the responsibility for delivering services to community-controlled Indigenous organisations with government departments only in a supporting role. Respondents also wanted a change in priorities, such as the inclusion of targets for mental health, youth suicide and the preservation of culture and languages.
 
 The federal government should consider these suggestions in reforming Closing the Gap but this must not just be a one-off consultation. If the federal government is serious about including Indigenous people, it should set up a standing consultative body drawn from different regions and backgrounds. In fact, such a body could serve as a prototype for the constitutionally enshrined Indigenous Voice requested in the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017.
 
 Giving Indigenous people more say both in the day-to-day administration of justice and in national decision-making bodies would be the best way to respond to the anger expressed in the Black Lives Matter demonstrations.

163,WHERE ARE ALL THE DOLLARS STOLEN FROM ABORIGINES?,News,2021-10-04T23:45:41.182Z,"The money owing remains unfinished business for many First Nations families What if I was to tell you about stolen wages? No, I’m not talking about some employer underpaying their workers.
 
 I’m talking about the wages of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians being taken by governments and never paid back.
 
 During the “Protection era”, the period from about the early 1900s until the 1970s, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians lived under various “Aborigines Protection Acts” and equivalents in each Australian state and territory. These acts were abolished after the 1967 referendum.
 
 Under these regimes, wages of Indigenous workers were paid to government-administered accounts, controlled by protectors or superintendents of Indigenous missions and reserves. It was believed Indigenous people wouldn’t be able to handle their money, so governments had to look after it for them. Some people had all wages taken and others were paid only a fraction of their income. Other payments were also taken, such as child endowment and pensions. Most never saw the money again.
 
 In theory, the money was supposed to be spent for the welfare of those people. In fact, most of it was swallowed up by governments, spent on general public projects and infrastructure and funding budgets of government departments. Some even went into consolidated revenue. Proper records weren’t kept or they disappeared. Money was misused or unaccounted for. Research by historian Ros Kidd estimates the Queensland government took between $200m and $500m this way and found evidence of misuse of the money, including fraud. And in any case, these wages were usually lower than non-Indigenous people earned for the same work.
 
 This is a dark part of our nation’s history. It’s a basic human right — and a fundamental principle of the liberal democratic system Australia inherited from Britain — that a person should be paid for their labour. It’s a principle of the free market that people are entitled to earn wages and to choose how those wages are spent, not have them paid to someone else against their will.
 
 Those principles should apply equally to all Australians. I don’t think anyone in this country, whatever their politics, would disagree.
 
 So why are governments finding it so hard to resolve and pay Indigenous people the money they are due?
 
 Indigenous people talk about unfinished business. This is a major area of unfinished business in this country: the recovery of wages earned by Indigenous people but never paid to them. Indigenous Australians have for decades been battling for these workers and their families.
 
 Indigenous wages and savings reparation schemes have been set up by various governments, but the conditions of these schemes and the payouts available have resulted in people receiving well below what was taken from them.
 
 An example was the Queensland government’s Indigenous Wages and Savings Reparation Scheme set up in 2002. The conditions of the scheme included the claimant being alive as of May 9, 2002, and releasing the Queensland government from any future liability. People could only apply for $2000 or $4000 capped payments, depending on their age. Top-up payments of $1500 and $3000 were offered later. About a quarter of the estimated number of people whose wages were taken and who were eligible received payment.
 
 A scheme in Western Australia, which ran from March to November 2012, was significantly less generous again, paying only $2000 per claimant. About 2000 applications were received but only about 1200 approved, with total payments $2.5m.
 
 A few thousand dollars for a lifetime of work. It’s pathetic. So a class action was launched in Queensland in 2016. The proceedings were settled in 2019 for $190m. The class consisted of almost 12,000 claimants with about 70 per cent being claims on behalf of deceased estates.
 
 Some people might question whether payments should be made when the worker is deceased. Why shouldn’t they? The great Australian dream is to earn a living, buy a home and pass it to your children. Many Indigenous people were denied this opportunity, unable to build up a nest egg for their children like other Australians. Why shouldn’t the descendants of workers whose wages were stolen be able to recover those wages? And this isn’t compensation, or even reparations. It’s paying back wages that were earned.
 
 Last week a complaint on behalf of about 20,000 First Nation Australians was lodged in the Australian Human Rights Commission, claiming in the vicinity of $400m from the West Australian government. Future actions are also likely in NSW and the Northern Territory.
 
 We might expect a private company to resist large claims, but these are governments. The same governments who talk about closing the gap and ending Indigenous disparity. Why is it so hard for them to pay people money they took through discriminatory and immoral laws?
 
 Many Indigenous Australians died before seeing justice, as negotiations and court cases were drawn out over decades. It doesn’t have to be like this.
 
 It’s time for negotiations between Indigenous Australians and the state and territory governments to be expedited so we can put a dark period of our history behind us. It’s time those who worked and contributed to the building of our nation receive the just rewards of their labour.

164,WHY DROP THE BALL ON OUR KEY INDIGENOUS TARGETS?,News,2020-01-13T03:11:20.712Z,"COVID is not the reason for Closing the Gap failures
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic — and government responses to it — has halted large sections of the economy, resulting in business failures and increased unemployment.
 
 With so many facing straitened circumstances, there is a risk indigenous disadvantage will be overshadowed, and the only solution to Closing the Gap will be ignored. Instead, there needs to be renewed focus on the solution: economic participation.
 
 An assessment of indigenous policy 12 months into this term of the Australian government shows indigenous affairs has lost its focus on economic participation.
 
 With the establishment of the National Indigenous Australians Agency, policy control appears to have shifted from the Prime Minister and the Indigenous Australians Minister to bureaucrats.
 
 There’s a waning focus on economic participation. This must return, particularly with the immense economic disruption we’re seeing. If it doesn’t, Ken Wyatt’s most significant achievement will be to trash six years of groundbreaking work by the Coalition government in this area.
 
 There are serious concerns about the proposed refresh of the Closing the Gap targets. There are minimal targets for economic development, including employment, and the school attendance target would be abolished. It was disappointing to see consistent attendance data disappear from the 2020 Closing the Gap Report. And now it’s proposed to remove even aggregate attendance targets. School attendance is fundamental to education; education is fundamental to employment. There’s no employment gap for indigenous and non-indigenous Australians educated at the same levels. But research shows a child doesn’t receive an effective education if their school attendance falls below 90 per cent.
 
 An aggregate attendance rate of 70 per cent could mean half are attending 90 per cent of the time, the other half only 50 per cent, or all students are attending 70 per cent of the time. In the first situation, half are getting an effective education. In the second situation, none are. This is an abject failure by commonwealth, state and territory governments and bureaucrats, including the NIAA, in their responsibilities to improve indigenous education. Employment and education targets won’t be achieved if school attendance doesn’t improve.
 
 Likewise, the proposed targets to reduce indigenous incarceration rates. Setting incarceration ceiling targets is madness and will see pressure for reduced penalties or non-enforcement, even when justified by the offence. Instead, we need targets to reduce crime and reoffending, particularly in indigenous communities. Imagine if governments, authorities and indigenous peak bodies were charged with reducing violence instead of the consequences of it. And if indigenous children don’t go to school, then into the workforce, they’re much more likely to end up in jail. Yet the school attendance target will be abolished and parity in indigenous employment targeted for 30 years away.
 
 The Abbott government set a new direction for indigenous affairs with a core focus on economic and business development. The Indigenous Advancement Strategy recognised being able to participate in the real economy through setting up a business is a vitally important pathway to indigenous economic participation.
 
 This was supported by the Indigenous Procurement Policy and the Indigenous Business Sector Strategy, which included an Indigenous Entrepreneurs Fund to provide or unlock capital and finance to indigenous businesses, particularly for wholly owned indigenous businesses that struggle to access mainstream finance (as in remote communities).
 
 The IBSS was ambitious and innovative. Nothing like this had been seen in indigenous policy. We expected it would have to be refined as it developed. What we didn’t expect was the momentum of the IBSS falling away as it has done in the past 12 months.
 
 The IEF ceased on June 30 last year, having provided less than half the originally allocated funding pool to only 111 indigenous businesses. The IBSS remains on the NIAA website but I’ve seen little focus from the NIAA in starting and sustaining indigenous businesses or building real economies in regional and remote communities where this is most needed. The most important priority for all governments now is to enable an environment for the creation of jobs; this won’t happen without a thriving business sector. The focus on indigenous business needs to return. It’s not simply “nice to have” — it’s crucial.
 
 In 2017 I developed a detailed model for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet on how to kickstart business creation in remote indigenous communities. The groundwork has been done. What’s required is action. In this time of COVID-19 the focus (still) needs to be economic participation. Governments have dropped the ball. COVID-19 can’t be an excuse not to pick it back up.

165,Wrestling with history of the victors,Fairfax,2021-11-18T23:14:29.289Z,"We're not only living through historic times as the pandemic cracks open fault lines in our society. History itself - the story of the past - is at issue. What was the extent of slavery in Australia? Is the version of history that's perpetuated by statues of Great Men one we want to live with? Was - we may as well go there - the European settlement of Australia tantamount to genocide?
 
 ""I wasn't taught that at school"" is a common cry from people who grew up with the privilege of not inheriting a history of oppression when confronted with the uncomfortable truth.
 
 Well, no, of course you weren't. Because academic history has a fault line of its own. It relies on evidence - archives and written records - created by the ""winners"" of history. And a lot of the ugly stuff was simply left out.
 
 That might be why a lot of writers who are interested in the past, and how it got us to today, are writing fiction. When the records of what happened aren't there, but the results clearly are, the best way to tell the truth can be to make it up.
 
 I've just spent seven years, on and off, as a PhD student contemplating how historical fiction works. I've read a lot of great history books, and some even greater historical fiction. But when I tell people about my studies, they often haven't heard of some of our best truth-tellers. I mention Kim Scott, a Noongar man who has two Miles Franklin prizes, and I get blank looks. Even blanker looks greet the name of Alexis Wright, a writer as original as James Joyce, who has said that her elders gave her the task of writing her people's stories. I have more luck with Kate Grenville, whose retelling of the invasion of the Hawkesbury River by her own ancestors in The Secret River is controversial, but at least gives more than lip service to an Indigenous presence.
 
 ""I wasn't taught that at school"" could be a poor excuse for not knowing about the history and present of Indigenous life in Australia. But I think it's more along the lines of Henry Reynolds' book title Why Weren't We Told? - a recognition that at some level, history has failed us. The question is: if you weren't taught ""that"" at school (and I certainly wasn't), what are you going to do to find out?
 
 If you want to listen to black voices, you don't need to seek out Indigenous people and pepper them with questions. Ever since Wurundjeri elder William Barak dictated his story to a scribe in the early 1880s, right through to the clarion call of the Uluru Statement, the voices have been there for those who choose to listen. The recent upsurge in the sales of Indigenous authors suggests that a lot of us are ready to do that.
 
 And the reading is far from a chore: Kim Scott's That Deadman Dance is flat-out beautiful - a trip through time and space to the coastal country of Western Australia in the 1800s. His novel Benang incorporates real archives, mocking the 19th-century obsession with percentages of ""blood"" and returning humanity to people dehumanised by colonial authority. Reading Bruce Pascoe's Dark Emu is like sitting around a fire with a rambling but unmistakably well-informed bloke who's ready to set you straight on how things were. Claire G. Coleman has given the past a sci-fi twist, and Tony Birch's short stories are jewels of observation and dialogue.
 
 Non-Indigenous writers are filling in the gaps too. Once you read Rohan Wilson's Western-esque Tasmanian novel The Roving Party you'll never see John Batman the same way again, and Matthew Kneale's English Passengers comically exposes the arrogance of ""explorers"" being guided by the locals.
 
 Coming to terms with what you find in these books is another question. Historian BaiN Attwood has said non-Indigenous Australians should do more than try to understand black history, they should also look squarely at their own and try to identify with even the most unattractive of ""settlers"", because otherwise we might fool ourselves that ""we could never be perpetrators"".
 
 Winston Churchill said history is written by the victors. I'm more interested in Shakespeare's take: ""Truth will out."" In the world of the historical novel, the archives are only what the victors have left behind. There's still time, these stories suggest, to write a different story.

166,Young Australians taking a hard look at political world,Fairfax,2021-06-17T05:18:18.594Z,"Young people aren't disinterested in politics - they're just frustrated with politicians, 25-year-old Kareem El-Ansary believes. And he has had 10,000 conversations to prove it.
 
 ""Those common tropes that have been flung at us that we are disengaged, that we are complacent, that we don't care, they're just false,"" he says.
 
 El-Ansary spent last year travelling around Australia as a United Nations Youth Representative visiting 60 places, from schools and not-for-profits to juvenile detention centres.
 
 In Sydney, he met a 12-year-old boy with autism and ADHD at an under-resourced public school, who became emotional explaining his struggle to find support in class. In the Northern Territory, young kids expressed their frustration at the criminal justice system and cycles of incarceration from a young age. In Hobart, he spoke to a 19-year-old Muslim woman who had to change her name on job applications because she sounded ""too ethnic"". In Mount Isa, an Indigenous boy admitted having to voluntarily open his bag when he entered stores so he wasn't accused of stealing.
 
 As diverse as these experiences are, one message came across in all of them.
 
 ""By and large, young people look at politicians in our political system and don't really see themselves reflected back. And when you don't see yourself reflected back, you're not really going to want to engage with the system,"" El-Ansary says. While he found one in 10 young Australians didn't feel represented by the political system, two-thirds were interested in learning more about how the government works.
 
 ""That illustrates to me that there's a real appetite for young people to engage,"" he says during a Zoom call from his home in Canberra. Since moving to the capital from Melbourne to work for the Department of Health, El-Ansary has been assisting the government on policies affecting young people - including the creation of a national youth policy framework. COVID-19 has given urgency to his work.
 
 ""We know that this recession is going to impact young people disproportionately, and that we're going to have to bear a lot of the burden in terms of rebuilding our economy,"" he says. ""So the challenge for the government is, how do we really support people to be able to do that?""
 
 Fresh out of an arts degree at Melbourne University, 25-year-old El-Ansary was hired at the Oaktree Foundation, an NGO run entirely by people under 26, to become national director of the Live Below the Line campaign. He then worked as chief executive of the Asia-Pacific Youth Organisation before being hired for the UN youth role - which included an address to the General Assembly in New York last October.
 
 ""I saw Australia in a way that few other people ever get to,"" he says of his year-long tour. ""You go out into really remote communities where people are living vastly different lives to those in inner-city Melbourne, but they're still talking about opportunity and jobs and climate change and mental health and education.""
 
 Climate anxiety was one issue El-Ansary found everywhere. He reached Townsville just after the floods in February, as the community was struggling with rebuilding. Other agricultural towns he visited were living with extreme drought.
 
 ""I had 11-year-olds talking about data privacy and how we can solve the mental health problem and improve services, and how we can tackle climate change,"" he says.
 
 ""We know this generation is more entrepreneurial than any that have come before and we also know that they are volunteering in greater numbers.""
 
 El-Ansary was concerned to see the ""really disturbing numbers"" of young people rushing to withdraw their super when the pandemic began. ""If you withdraw $10,000 or $20,000 now, that could be over $100,000 in lost savings. Young people may not fully understand the long-term implications of that.""
 
 He argues we need to build an education system that, rather than focusing on rote learning, teaches kids practical financial literacy skills, civics and how to participate in a democracy.
 
 ""What I saw at the UN was a period of uncertainty and disruption. I saw increased rhetoric which rejected globalism and embraced nationalism and protectionism, mostly led by the United States,"" he says.
 
 But he doesn't think Trump's more aggressive policies have stopped global institutions from being able to act cohesively.
 
 ""It just means other countries really have to step up now.""
 
 While El-Ansary admits the uncertainty of the pandemic was ""quite scary"", he has decided to see it as an opportunity to figure out what sustainable system we can build in which young people have a proper seat at the table.
 
 Does he have political ambitions? ""I've thought about it - particularly when I was young. And look, I haven't ruled it out,"" he says. ""But I think I'm more interested in policy at the moment rather than politics.""

167,A blanket ban on phones in detention is unacceptable,Others,2021-02-22T20:01:50.868Z,"During lockdown, many of us - myself included - have become even more reliant on our mobile phones. They have kept us in contact with parents, children and grandchildren, our colleagues and friends during this difficult time.
 
 When my two-year-old first saw his grandmother on a smartphone, he squealed with delight. It wasn't quite the same as being together - he pawed at the screen to try to touch her - but it was a meaningful way of maintaining their connection.
 
 Being in lockdown is not the same as being locked up. However, because of COVID-19, we have all now experienced, on a small scale, what it's like to have our freedom restricted. We know first-hand how vital technology can be in maintaining our human connections during isolation.
 
 As Australia's Human Rights Commissioner, my role includes inspecting Australia's immigration detention facilities. During these inspections, detainees have frequently told me how phone calls with loved ones give them hope, and sometimes even a reason to live.
 
 For people in immigration detention, a mobile phone can be a lifeline - and particularly so in Australia where the average period of immigration detention is more than 500 days. This is far longer than almost any other comparable country.
 
 So, I was concerned when I read the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2020. This new bill would allow a ban on mobile phones in immigration detention facilities.
 
 Banning mobile phones for people who pose a demonstrable security risk would be understandable. However, this Bill would go further. The Minister for Home Affairs would be able to ban mobile phones for anyone - or for everyone - in a detention facility.
 
 In introducing this Bill, the government has said it doesn't plan to introduce a blanket ban on mobile phones - that any ban would be to address risks to health, safety, security or order. This strengthens the argument for the Bill being redrafted, so it is precisely targeted to achieving this aim.
 
 The Commission has made a submission to a parliamentary committee that says the bill should not proceed.
 
 The Commission recommends that risks be considered on a case-by-case basis. If a particular person in detention has used their phone to commit illegal activity or endanger the security of Australia, this would be a reason to prohibit them from having a phone. But it would not justify a ban that applies to other people who haven't been shown to be a risk.
 
 People convicted of criminal offences can be sent to prison as punishment. However, the Australian Constitution and international law both make clear that immigration detention cannot be used to punish someone.
 
 This might seem like a lawyerly distinction; whatever the purpose, detention has serious negative effects on people who are locked up. But the distinction matters, because it means that the government must take all reasonable steps to limit the punitive impact of immigration detention.
 
 Removing a mobile phone from someone in immigration detention will impinge on their basic rights like freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Yes, most people in detention have access to some landline phones and computers, but these are in common areas, only available at certain times and they are shared devices. This equipment is important, but it's not the same as having a mobile phone that enables you to reach out to those you love when you need them most.
 
 As community restrictions on movement and gathering start to be relaxed around Australia, people in immigration detention remain in isolation with their visits curtailed. Even when normal visit arrangements resume, people in detention will still be detained.
 
 Any restrictions on technology should be targeted very carefully so that innocent people are not harmed.
 
 And the risk of harm is real. Asylum seekers in immigration detention in Australia are already more than 200 times more likely to engage in self harm than people in the Australian community. We should be looking at ways to make immigration detention more bearable, not less.

168,A jobs survey provides hope of a faster recovery,News,2020-07-14T17:53:27.961Z,"Until JobKeeper goes, the real jobless rate is a mystery In a deluge of depressing economic news the latest unemployment figures are a welcome, if surprising, relief. Far from rising significantly, as economists expected, the jobless rate dropped to 6.8 per cent from 7.5 per cent in July, the first decline since the start of the pandemic. More than 110,000 new jobs were created between July and August, the month Victoria crushed activity in the nation’s second-biggest state with a second, more severe lockdown to combat the coronavirus. Since June, the economy has recovered roughly half the jobs it lost between March and May, according to the latest labour force figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Capital Economics, an economic consultancy, said the unemployment rate was unlikely to climb to 8.5 per cent, as it had anticipated, let alone the 10 per cent predicted by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Treasury.
 
 Whether on the epidemiological or economic front, it has not been a good year for forecasters. But dig a little deeper and some of the gloss comes off. Hours worked, a measure that pierces some of the confusion created by JobKeeper and JobSeeker — which see idle workers and some unemployed workers not counted — rose by only 0.1 per cent, dragged down by an unsurprising 4.8 per cent drop in Victoria. Separate real data — the ABS figures are based on a survey of about 25,000 households in the first two weeks of the month — from the Australian Taxation Office, which tracks business payrolls, suggests the number of jobs declined 1 per cent, or about 120,000, from July to August.
 
 Most puzzling of all, all of the extra 111,000 jobs created across the month were “non-employees” — that is, contractors or sole traders. “We think delivery drivers contracted to the major online delivery companies drove today’s outcome,” Deutsche Bank economist Phil O’Donaghoe said. “There will have been a significant increase in demand for such workers, especially in Victoria during the month given lockdown conditions.” Roy Morgan, which conducts a separate unemployment survey, reckons the unemployment rate rose from 12.5 per cent to 13.8 per cent last month. Only when JobKeeper, with about 3.5 million recipients, is wound down and JobSeeker reverts to a lower level will we see the true impact of the coronavirus and our powerful response to it. That’s not far off. By the end of next week, both payments will have dropped $300 a fortnight. “These things can’t go off into the never-never and they have to be wound down,” Scott Morrison said, rightly, on Thursday. Not only do these payments add billions to public debt, they also reduce the incentive to look for work and create zombie businesses that ultimately must be wound down to adjust to the new economic reality.
 
 The challenge for the government will be to hone the incentives to work by paring back support without seeming uncaring. It won’t be easy politically — business and welfare groups inevitably will demand that various support measures be extended — but it’s economically necessary to ensure the nation’s better starting position, especially on the fiscal front, isn’t entirely eroded during this unfortunate and unexpected experience. The coronavirus recession is likely to shift the pattern of household and business spending permanently, in unpredictable ways. Amid the new opportunities, many businesses will not survive. Nonetheless, a lower unemployment rate is a psychological win when business and household confidence is reeling. For the Morrison government, which is putting the finishing touches to the budget that will be handed down on October 6 and that will lay out the practical and philosophical path out of the coronavirus recession, it was particularly welcome. A better headline jobless rate also takes pressure off the Reserve Bank to pursue more extreme monetary policy, too. Better jobs figures provide a glimmer of hope, at least, that some sort of “snapback” is possible in the next year. The OECD has upgraded its growth forecast for Australia for this year, saying real GDP would contract by 4.1 per cent, or by 0.9 per cent less than it forecast in June. But it slashed projected growth for 2021 to 2.5 per cent, not 4.1 per cent as previously estimated. Whatever the outlook, Australia is in a better position than New Zealand, whose economy shrank 12.2 per cent in the second quarter of the year, almost twice as great a decline as Australia’s, which decreased 7 per cent across the same period.",784
169,A national health problem tougher than COVID-19,Fairfax,2020-07-05T05:58:48.781Z,"Wilcannia lies where the Barrier Highway crosses the Darling River, about 200 kilometres east of Broken Hill. The town was once a thriving inland port boasting a population of 3000.
 
 When the river ran high, paddle steamers would ply the tricky waterway and, in floods, locals claim they set out over the drowned landscape. In droughts, the river dropped so low the boats got stranded, sometimes for years.
 
 There was a drought in NSW in 1981, the river was a trickle and the town was a shattered remnant of a grander past, with a population of about 600. I was 20, in a seminary, and had come to spend eight weeks on a mission run by a Catholic society of nuns, the Daughters of Compassion.
 
 The sisters were an odd fit. The society was founded in New Zealand and had been asked by the region's bishop to work with the Aboriginal people in 1962. They came, set up a dispensary and a school, and nearly 20 years on were still rotating their women through the mission. So there, in the middle the outback, were three Kiwi nuns: one nurse and two teachers. They were courageous, self-sufficient, selfless and well regarded. They introduced me to some of the traditional owners, the Barkindji people.
 
 On a blazing afternoon in January, I went with an elder to ""the Malley"", a shanty town on the edge of the settlement with a tumbledown collection of homes that were mostly thrown together pieces of corrugated iron. It was a study in poverty, an image of the Third World taken root in the heart of Australia.
 
 Wilcannia was hard and sharply divided between the few whites and the majority of Indigenous people. Windows on shopfronts and homes were barred, and that scarred it with a sense of lurking violence.
 
 The school year was about to start and young teachers' college graduates were arriving to serve an indentured year before they could decide for themselves where to live and work. Few stayed longer than their contract demanded, so the school churned through staff.
 
 The sisters told me of one lad who had driven from a Sydney seaside suburb to serve out his time but after taking one look at the town had filled his car and headed home, looking for a new career.
 
 I met a 30-something teacher who had come and stayed for a decade. He had started a printing venture with the Barkindji people, to publish their stories for the children. He was also part of another project, recovering the Barkindji language. Only fragments survived and a team was collecting every remaining word to try to piece it back together.
 
 Nothing on that journey was more shocking than that revelation. Without their language, the Barkindji were wandering mute in their own land, robbed of the ability to properly describe it and define themselves. No longer able to navigate the black world and shut out of the white one as surely as the bars that guarded shop windows.
 
 This was what dispossession really meant: the theft of a people's voice and their identity. It is a soul-deep trauma.
 
 In the late '70s and early '80s, I saw this dispossession in other places, hiding in plain sight. It was in the St Martin de Porres centre in Sydney's Redfern, which then tended to those fighting poverty, alcoholism, drug addiction and despair.
 
 It was in a now-defunct boy's home in Windsor, west of Sydney. In a grand touch of irony, the Daruk Training School was named after the local Indigenous people, which was grimly fitting given some of the 14 to 16-year-old boys inside were their descendants. The name disguised a prison and it was no surprise, years later, to learn it had become a focus for the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.
 
 Too often, ingrained Indigenous disadvantage is like Wilcannia, Redfern or Daruk, a place on the edge of our vision that we can hurry past with barely a glance if we chose. George Floyd's death makes that harder to do because we know it is as relevant here as anywhere on Earth.
 
 Aboriginal dispossession is the Original Sin of Australia's settlement. Unless we can find a way to reconcile it then the stain will linger, destroying Indigenous people's lives and forever marring the rest of the nation. You can look back in anger at the past but that won't change it.
 
 What is needed is the political will to confront it as a more enlightened nation, seek a cure and endure, across decades.
 
 National cabinet has proven itself in dealing with a short-term crisis in the coronavirus. It would be good if the premiers and Prime Minister now set their sights on a much more intractable problem. The health of the nation depends on it.

170,A real chance to address mental health,Others,2021-07-20T02:58:48.376Z,"For many of us, forced to work at home or to not work at all, the COVID-19 crisis has driven home the importance of mental health and how work interacts with our sense of wellbeing.
 
 The world-leading researcher and founding director of youth mental health foundation Headspace, Patrick McGorry, has warned that as the virus subsides we will see a big surge in the need for mental health care, including pain management.
 
 So it's with anticipation then that the Productivity Commission is set to release the final report of its 18-month inquiry into mental health and productivity in June.
 
 The draft report, released in October, is a good start - but it needs to be more holistic to inspire confidence and a reform agenda.
 
 It found that the economic costs of poor mental health were shockingly high, amounting to 10 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. That's before COVID-19.
 
 It reported that mental illness typically begins before the age of 25, but didn't expend much effort examining why.
 
 The draft report did acknowledge the need to focus on children and young people and early intervention as a way of improving mental health, but took too little account of the major risk factors that operate early in life including abuse in the home and poverty.
 
 Although it has been well established that poverty contributes to inadequate housing which contributes to stress, the inquiry's chairman, Stephen King, said at the outset that addressing poverty and inequality was beyond his terms of reference.
 
 It's a lost opportunity. King's inquiry could have and should have the courage to examine if not tackle some of the things that lie behind mental illness, especially given what COVID-19 lockdowns reinforced about the role of inequality.
 
 There have been many earlier government reports on mental health, but this one is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reset how we view it. Mental and public healthcare workers have been urging the commission to make prevention the centre of the report's recommendations.
 
 While no one in those sectors will reject the extra services that the report is likely to offer, they want more done to address the underlying causes of mental health issues.
 
 Better access to safe and secure housing would be a start. As would consideration of what it will mean for more of us to work from home post-crisis, if that's what happens.
 
 Working from home can not only further blur the lines between home and work, creating new stresses, it can contribute to sedentary lifestyles that can make people more likely to develop depression. Then there is the question of ""are we really more productive working from home?"".
 
 The coronavirus crisis has highlighted the importance of connecting in real ways, as well as through a screen.
 
 And it serves as something of a dress rehearsal for the next, more serious crisis.
 
 The draft report included only a cursory reference to climate change. Its impacts on work, mental health and economic productivity are likely to be much worse.
 
 It brings us back to the fundamental notion that when health is a priority and health inequalities diminish, the population is better able to recover from whatever shocks it faces and an economy can better recover.
 
 After COVID-19, we should not reduce the safety net to shrink national debt and deficit because that would be more devastating to people's health and productivity in the long term. It could make all the difference between finding hope and finding despair.

171,A strong message on youth detention,Fairfax,2020-03-26T11:32:09.122Z,"The High Court decision to rule that the use of tear gas on four youths at the Northern Territory's notorious Don Dale detention centre in 2014 was unlawful could not have come at a more appropriate time.
 
 Not that the court planned it this way, but the decision was announced against a backdrop of discontent in this nation and of course, the United States, about the excessive use of force by law enforcement against those they detain, including young people.
 
 The four detainees, aged between 15 and 17 in August 2014, claimed damages for assault and battery against the Northern Territory government for the use of spit hoods, leg shackles and handcuffs. But Justice Judith Kelly of the Territory's Supreme Court dismissed their claims based on the use of CS, or tear gas. As the ABC's Four Corners showed in a 2016 expose of Don Dale, there were 10 bursts of tear gas sprayed into the enclosed area containing six detainees over a period of 90 seconds.
 
 Tear gas is, as the High Court noted, a dangerous substance. Justices Michelle Gordon and Joshua Edelman note that the gas ""disables those who breathe it by inducing uncontrollable burning and tearing of the eyes, and intense irritation of the nose and throat, causing profuse coughing and difficulty breathing"". While there is power in the Northern Territory to use it in adult detention, there is no power to use this weapon on children.
 
 So how was it that NT corrections officials thought it was fine to use such a dangerous weapon on such young individuals? Because officers from a nearby adult prison, three members of a so-called Immediate Action Team, turned up at the Don Dale centre ""equipped with masks, helmets, protective vests, shields, batons and CS foggers"", according to the High Court, the latter being the device used to spray tear gas.
 
 The officers acted as though they were dealing with adults. It was an unlawful action, an overreach of power by the state. If it had not been for media exposure in 2016 by the ABC's Four Corners, this case would never have been investigated.
 
 If we reflect on the High Court's decision, what can we learn? The most obvious point is that we need to keep a close watch on how those who administer and operate centres of detention, whether they are adult prisons, youth detention facilities or immigration detention centres, exercise their powers.
 
 Particularly in the context of Victoria's recent troubled youth detention environment, the High Court decision sends a timely reminder that there are real limits around the use of force against vulnerable groups such as children and youth. In adult detention similarly, the use of so-called heavily armed military-style special operations or tactical response groups does not mean the law against excessive use of force has no application.
 
 But more fundamentally, why is it that the use of force is thought to be acceptable in youth detention at all? In Victoria, after a breakout from the Malmsbury youth detention centre in 2017, the Andrews government approved the use of tear gas in youth detention. Daniel Andrews saw nothing untoward about it, saying he supported ""our officers having available to them the equipment, the expertise and the training that is required to make sure that these places are as orderly as they can be, and that they are secure"".
 
 The detaining of children and young people in prison-like detention facilities where the use of force, lawful and unlawful, happens far too often, should end.

173,Balance needed on new gig worker laws,Fairfax,2021-01-06T00:13:20.331Z,"Next time you get take-away delivered to your home, it's worth taking a moment to reflect on the person who delivered the food. While the task of getting the meal to your door is relatively simple, the manner in which that person is employed has become one of the most contentious and complex debates in workplace relations in Australia and many other nations.
 
 The Victorian government is about to wade into that debate. This week it released the largest ever survey of gig economy workers in Australia. The 18-month study found nearly 14 per cent of working-age Victorians have carried out on-demand work. Mostly young, urban and male, they are often living with a disability or temporary residents. Many speak a language other than English at home. Working for digital platforms such as Airtasker and Uber, they are mostly classified as independent contractors who do not have access to the same protections as employees, including unfair dismissal provisions, sick leave and the minimum wage.
 
 The survey revealed genuine concerns. More than 30 per cent did not know if their platform had a dispute resolution process, while nearly half said they were not provided with work-related insurance. On the flip side, nearly half of gig workers do less than five hours a week, suggesting it is a second job for many, and more than half saw their earnings as ""nice to have"" but something they could live without. Only 15 per cent said the money was essential for basic needs.
 
 The use of contractors has been a legitimate practice for decades, often in the case of a company temporarily employing an expert for a specific task. But firms have in recent years taken advantage of contract laws to employ large numbers of workers to do menial tasks and treated them as an inferior grade of employee. In Australia, efforts to give these workers better rights have had mixed success.
 
 Two years ago, the Fair Work Commission set a precedent in deciding that an ex-Foodora deliver rider was unfairly dismissed and was not an independent contractor. However, this April the commission found an Uber Eats driver was a contractor, concluding such drivers were not employees because they lacked some of the ""essential hallmarks of an employment relationship"". They were able to log on and off at will and to simultaneously work for other food delivery platforms.
 
 It has been a battle fought on many fronts. In California, the government is forcing the likes of Uber to fully employ drivers with the backing of a court ruling that compels firms to show that a contract worker operates autonomously and their tasks are not central to the business. In New York, Uber had to give drivers a minimum wage.
 
 After recently passing legislation to crack down on wage theft, irritating the federal government, which is planning its own laws, the Andrews government has set its sights on the gig economy. State Industrial Relations Minister Tim Pallas is adamant the gig-worker report shows the need to give these workers more protection.
 
 It's a commendable goal, but one fraught with challenges and in need of a national approach. There is no question some companies' business model is based on large numbers of contractors working for minimal pay and entitlements. Those workers deserve better. But it's also important any new laws do not inhibit many in the gig economy who value flexible work arrangements and can at times command higher wages. Victoria should working with the federal government and the Fair Work Commission to ensure it strikes the right balance.",612
174,"BALL IS IN PREMIERS’ COURT: WE MUST REOPEN, AND QUICKLY",News,2021-04-21T01:46:54.350Z,"The states control the recovery, even though the PM wears the accountability
 
 The Morrison government is ­exposed to a potentially high-risk dilemma: the states will determine the timing of the economic recovery, how many small businesses will live or die and how many workers will return to jobs, while Scott Morrison will largely be held accountable in political terms.
 
 The potential for multi-jurisdictional conflict is more ­potent in reopening the economy than it was in shutting it down. ­Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson said of the government’s $214bn fiscal ­packages: “The problem is that the cost and benefits fall unevenly across jurisdictions. An economist would say the cost of the economic packages have accrued mainly to the federal government while the benefits have accrued mainly to the states.” Economic reality is compounded by political reality. The federal government, as usual, is held responsible for the economy while the premiers, as agreed by the national cabinet, are the decision-makers on the timing of economic recovery — an unusual situation induced by the virus. It is a fault line between decision-making and ­accountability.
 
 The success of the premiers in fighting COVID-19 has been underwritten by the massive support provided by the Morrison government and the private banks in keeping businesses afloat, workers tied to their companies and the unemployed on a doubled JobSeeker allowance. Australia’s fiscal packages equate to 10 per cent of gross domestic product, one of the largest globally. For the past 10 weeks the premiers have thrived, sitting in the national cabinet but popular because of their battle against the virus.
 
 That equation is finished. There is a new politics inaugurated by the national cabinet. The challenge facing the premiers has just got harder, despite the life-and-death war they have recently waged. They must simultaneously manage the economic recovery but contain the inevitable virus outbreaks.
 
 The situation was summarised by the Deloitte Access Economics report: “Our nation will begin its recovery with unemployment high, the private sector scared, the Reserve Bank tapped out and ­prices for our key exports weak. That says Australia’s recovery will be strikingly dependent on the extent to which our governments — federal and state — switch their policies away from the virus sprint and towards the recovery marathon.” This constitutes the greatest challenge premiers have faced since World War II. Can Gladys Berejiklian and Daniel Andrews, heading the two main states, make the switch? How committed are they to attacking the intolerable levels of unemployment? How will they react when virus breakouts occur and they face demands, ­including media pressure, to revert to shutdown? Will they have the courage to stick by the economic opening or will they buckle?
 
 Richardson said: “The judgment we face is how much extra risk we incur by inviting the virus back in set against the extra bang we get for the economy and jobs. The states need to think about this.
 
 “We have a lot to lose. We know the virus is not beaten but Australia is in a better position than most other nations to take risks on economic recovery. If we can open up quickly, if we can ease restrictions within the six-month period, that makes so many other things easier for us. You get a virtuous cycle — the more we get the economy to grow, the more confidence we get in our recovery.” But this isn’t just about the economy. It is about the people who are the economy. There are 1.4 million people on the unemployment benefit JobSeeker, there are 5.5 million workers enrolled in JobKeeper, with 835,000 businesses having signed up, and there are more than 450,000 small businesses, many close to the fiscal cliff, receiving cash support.
 
 As Richardson said, it is the premiers who must now judge these competing risks between the economy and health. Their earlier reluctance on reopening schools, particularly Andrews’s resistance, hardly inspires confidence.
 
 The performance of the three premiers — Berejiklian, Andrews and Queensland’s Annastacia Palaszczuk — on the ABC’s Q+A program on Monday was revealing. Each performed stro­ngly. Each has grown in stature during the crisis. Yet the program’s focus was overwhelmingly on the risks from easing restrictions, not on the obligations to save people’s jobs, livelihoods and lives.
 
 Australia is staring down the gun barrel of 10 per cent unemployment. Yet the unemployment crisis, possibly the worst since the Great Depression, and the wipe-out facing thousands of small businesses were hardly mentioned. How could this be? Was this an accurate measure of public sentiment, or of the mentality of the premiers, or just a devastating ­example of ABC programs being divorced from the real world?
 
 The Prime Minister defines the task endorsed by the national cabinet as a three-stage process to achieve a COVID-safe economy by July that will see the restoration of 850,000 jobs and an increase in GDP of $9.4bn each month. The entire timetable is just the next 10 weeks. The onus rests with the premiers. There is not a day to be lost, let alone a week. The timetable will never be achieved unless the premiers are fully pledged to the task, with its economic, health and political challenges.
 
 The issue is whether Australia will build on its health success to achieve economic success or succumb to a semi-permanent broken economy. It is accepted that different states will move at different rates. But Morrison nailed the issue: “We cannot allow our fear of going backwards from stopping us from going forward.” Treasury has identified the ­restored jobs target for each state to July: 280,000 jobs in NSW, 216,000 in Victoria and 174,000 in Queensland. The main industries and events that will boost GDP are retail, schools reopening and hospitality (cafes, pubs, clubs). How committed are the big-state premiers to these targets if the going gets tough?
 
 The Reserve Bank in its statement last week made clear the faster the recovery, the less the lasting damage to the economy. If there is recovery “in the near term” with “more limited damage to business and household confidence”, then much of the decline in GDP growth and the rise in unemployment “would be reversed over the next few years”, it said.
 
 But Deloitte Access Economics warns Australia faces the risk of a slow recovery. In this situation, the central priority is the economy, not the budget. Richardson said: “If our economy gets better, so will the budget. The ‘mission accomplished’ signs can’t be put up until unemployment is back at 5 per cent, and on our forecasts that doesn’t happen until late 2024.” Richardson calls the trade-off from a quick recovery “stunning”. Josh Frydenberg says the cost of failing to lift restrictions is a $4bn weekly hit to economic activity. Morrison’s problem is that these are not his decisions but he foots the bill for most of the economic lockdown and, if NSW and Victoria are too slow and lack the incentive, he pays the political price for higher unemployment and a prolonged contraction. Of course, Morrison has his own economic responsibilities; he needs to keep spending if necessary and let some of the existing programs continue beyond six months to boost jobs and activity.
 
 The fight against unemployment must assume centre stage. This is the economic and moral obligation. It should be supported by all sides of politics, along with the essential task of containing the virus. The unemployment rate will fall in tandem with the economic ­reopening. Having a debate about what happens to JobKeeper in September is a crazy misunderstanding of priorities. What counts is what happens tomorrow, Thursday, Friday, next week and the week after. The task is meaningful recovery. The premiers, so far, have been judged by their success in fighting the virus, and the risk is they will cling to this fallback.But there is a new imperative — getting unemployment down without being forced back to shutdown. It’s the story that counts now. Let’s put it up in lights.",1373
175,Big donations reap sweet rewards,Fairfax,2020-03-06T02:17:52.118Z,"As the recession starts to bite, it's time to dig deep for those who haven't had a good crisis - and increase your tax return.
 
 Do the initials EOFY mean anything to you? It's a relatively new abbreviation, but it's become so widely used by marketers anxious to squeeze in one last bargain sale before their books close that you probably don't need me to tell you it stands for End of Financial Year.
 
 It's also become a standby for our tax-deductible charities which, at this time of year, are busy mailing their supporters to subtly remind them that a generous donation or two in the next few weeks would do much to fatten the refund cheque that's the reward awaiting us when we've submitted our tax return.
 
 As an accountant who's highly conscious of what's tax deductible and what's not - and who, in earlier times, did his share of knocking on doors, selling buttons on button day and rattling a collection box at the entrance to the show, but drew the line at helping his father sell the War Cry newspaper in pubs - EOFY looms large on my to-do list in the next few weeks.
 
 It's years since I've helped with the Salvos' Red Shield Appeal but, in any case, no house-to-house collection day was possible this year, for obvious reasons. Which is a pity since it means the Salvos will have a lot less ability to help those needing assistance, let alone the surge in families caught short by a recession likely to be still blighting many people's lives long after Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have triumphantly declared recovery and withdrawn their extra financial support.
 
 Thinking about it, tax deductibility is a way that we mere mortals can oblige our political masters to divert more taxpayer support to those causes to which we attach more importance than the pollies seem to. And, if that's your motivation, the knowledge much of what you give will be coming back to you should prompt you to give a lot more than you first thought of.
 
 Of course, the Salvos are far from the only charity caught short by their reliance on volunteer funding drives. A report published last week by Social Ventures Australia and the Centre for Social Impact at the University of NSW is a reminder that, apart from social distancing's disruption of fundraising events, donations always suffer when economic times are tough.
 
 There are more than 57,000 charities registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. Before the recession, they employed about 1.3 million people - one worker in 10 - and had 3.7 million volunteers. Charities provide a huge range of services: education, healthcare, sport and recreation, legal services, arts and culture, animal protection, environmental protection and more.
 
 Governments rely on charities to deliver services on their behalf: aged care, disability services, employment services (replacing the old Commonwealth Employment Service) and childcare and early learning. Governments also rely on charities to fill in the gaps in their systems. When the dole was only $40 a day - to which Morrison says he'll soon revert - they could be sure no one would starve because the Salvos, Vinnies and Mission Australia would be there to give them a feed or a food parcel.
 
 All those homeless people on the street? The Salvos, Vinnies and Mission Australia will do what they can. Maybe those people enjoy sleeping in parks and under railway bridges - specially in summer.
 
 People who get themselves deep in debt with multiple credit cards and pay-day lenders? Not to worry. I hear the Salvos have an excellent financial counselling service.
 
 Most charities have few reserves to fall back on when donations fall short. The report by Social Ventures Australia took a sample of 16,000 charities with 1.2 million employees and found that, should their revenue fall by 20 per cent, 88 per cent of them would immediately be making an operating loss, with 17 per cent at high risk of closing their doors within six months. More than 200,000 jobs could be lost as a result of cost-cutting and closures.
 
 To be fair, the Morrison government has modified its JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme so as to include charities and their employees, though the scheme is set to expire in September.
 
 Mitchell Evans, leader of the Salvos' Sydney Streetlevel Mission, says they are expecting ""an avalanche of need in the months to come, as the government's JobKeeper and additional funds under JobSeeker [unemployment benefits] conclude"".
 
 His mission in Surry Hills has seen a 60 per cent increase in demand for its meal services, and now provides 80 lunches every day.
 
 At Major Brendan Nottle's Project 614 in Bourke Street, Melbourne (where my cousin Barry is working), demand for emergency relief has now tripled to 90 people a day. ""We've particularly seen more men coming to us for help, often with a mate, as they're embarrassed and don't really know how to ask for help,"" Nottle says.
 
 As Morrison cuts back to be sure of affording the huge tax cuts he's promised high-income earners such as me in 2024, kicking the tin's the least I can do.

176,BLEAK TIMES BLEAKER STILL FOR THE YOUNG,News,2021-06-17T12:55:32.576Z,"School-leavers and university graduates will struggle for jobs and decent incomes
 
 These extraordinary weeks of self-isolation and social distancing leave plenty of time to contemplate what has come before, and what may lie ahead.
 
 I remember my great-aunt Elsie very well. Tall and thin as a rake, she had been married to ­George for a few months when he succumbed to the Spanish flu in 1919. She never remarried. She never had children. She lived for a time in boarding houses before buying a small house with a small garden. I can still remember her hurtling around the neighbourhood in her Morris Minor at a time when it was uncommon for women of her age to drive.
 
 The broader point is that certain events can have significant and sustained effects on people’s lives, careers and incomes. In the case of COVID-19, a fate similar to the one that befell aunt Elsie is unlikely to be much repeated for today’s young people. Older people are overwhelmingly the ones most likely to die of COVID-19.
 
 But the massive downturn in the economy associated with the current public health restrictions, which sparked widespread job losses, will likewise have a profound effect on the prospects of many people, both in an immediate way but also across time. The same goes for the interruptions to education and training.
 
 Economists have always been interested in whether recessions affect the longer-term job and income outcomes for people, particularly those seeking to enter the labour market during downturns. There have been plenty of ins­tances to work with, including here in Australia.
 
 Longitudinal data that tracks the same individuals across time have greatly assisted economists to estimate these effects, including by comparing similar cohorts who have been less affected by these adverse economic events.
 
 Take the Brookings Institution study by Steven Davis and Till von Wachter. Using the period 1974 to 2008, the authors estimate men in the US lost an average of 1.4 years of pre-displacement earnings if laid off when the national unemployment rate was less 6 per cent.
 
 But if the unemployment rate was greater than 8 per cent, the loss of earnings rose to 2.8 years of pre-displacement earnings. The broader state of the labour market matters a great deal.
 
 A recent study by two economists at the Reserve Bank of Australia, Zoya Dhillon and Natasha Cassidy, looked at labour market outcomes for younger people in Australia. With little work experience and often few job-specific skills, quite a few young people were found to struggle to secure a foothold in the labour market at the best of times.
 
 When the economy turned sour, however, the impact fell disproportionately on young people as they failed to secure jobs and were often the first to be laid off.
 
 These cyclical effects were overlaid by some structural changes in the labour market that have seen youth unemployment rise relative to overall unemployment. Additionally, the rate of underemployment — people wanting to work more hours — has been rising for young people, and the proportion of young people not in the labour force, employment or training (the so-called NEETs) has also increased.
 
 Having said this, another RBA study provides some grounds for optimism. Comparisons were made of the effects of three significant economic downturns in Australia — the early 1980s, the early 90s and the global financial crisis of 2008-09 — on unemployment and employment.
 
 The first two episodes were ­associated with soaring numbers of jobless, with the rates of unemployment rising by about five ­percentage points, trough to peak. Employment also dropped significantly, by between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent.
 
 In the mid-2000s, by contrast, the unemployment rate rose by less than two percentage points and the level of employment fell by only one-half of a percentage point. Overwhelmingly, reducing working hours of existing workers carried the burden of adjustment. The more flexible labour market arrangements that existed by then relative to the earlier periods facilitated this outcome.
 
 But before we get too excited by this result, bear in mind that the current restrictions on economic activity are deeming the operations of some employing enterprises prohibited or uneconomic.
 
 The scope for employers to reduce the working hours of their employees is very limited at this point, although there are doubtless examples.
 
 Rather, we have multiple instances of large-scale lay-offs and stand-downs, which point to a significant uptick in the rate of unemployment, with 10 per cent by the middle of the year not being out of the question.
 
 When it comes to interruptions to education and training, we don’t have very good data on this because instances of this occurring are so rare. We have estimates of the value of an extra year of schooling on individuals’ employment and earnings prospects but these are not particularly relevant to the current situation.
 
 There are estimates around the closing of schools potentially leading to a reduction in GDP of between 2 per cent and 8 per cent, depending on what assumptions are made about parents being forced to stay at home to look after children and the value of home-based learning.
 
 At the very least, the disruption to schooling is likely to have ­particularly adverse effects on children from more disadvantaged backgrounds relative to others. Children from more affluent households will have access to ­resources that should allow them to continue their education to some degree.
 
 The other point is that the disruption to education affects young people at certain junctures relative to others. For those doing Year 12, those who are about to graduate and those who have just graduated, the effects of the disruptions are particularly acute.
 
 The additional trouble for them is that next year there will be another group of slightly younger students and graduates who will be competing for the same university slots and jobs, assuming there is a return to a degree of normality by then.
 
 The bottom line is that we already know bad economic times can have deep and persistent scarring effects on many people, particularly the young.
 
 And it’s not only about their ­income and job prospects but also their mental health. Parents also will be faced with the prospect of their adult children staying even longer at home or ­returning to live at home.
 
 For a variety of reasons, this time around the damage is likely to be even greater than normal ­because of the speed and widespread nature of the downturn, as well as the closure or disruption to education and training.
 
 The government’s sizeable wage subsidy scheme is an attempt to retain connections between employers and workers as well as offer income relief. The hope is that some of the scarring effects of this unprecedented collapse in the labour market can be attenuated by such measures.Even so, further initiatives will be required in due course to help as many as people as possible ­resume rewarding education and career paths.",1186
177,BLUE-COLLAR JOBS ARE WORTHY TOO,News,2020-04-08T18:08:57.485Z,"Inner-city greens colourblind to others’ interests as they try to block development
 
 Labor senator Raff Ciccone’s statement at the weekend that “there is dignity in all work” is something mainstream Australians have always understood, and at last the political class appears to have cottoned on.
 
 Ciccone called for an overhaul of state and federal environmental laws to create more blue-collar jobs, and for limitations on legal injunctions — commonly referred to as “lawfare” — launched by activist green groups.
 
 Research by the Institute of Public Affairs estimated that the lawfare provision, section 487 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, has put more than $65bn of investment at risk in Australia by holding up major projects such as dams, coalmines and roads in court for a total of 10,100 days since the year 2000.
 
 Much of this investment is concentrated in job-starved regional communities and includes projects from the $16.5bn Adani coalmine in central Queensland to a $30m salmon farm in Tasmania.
 
 Graeme Samuel’s confirmation that there is evidence to support the existence of lawfare, which he spoke of in his joint press conference with Environment Minister Sussan Ley on Monday, reflects a growing consensus that jobs must be put ahead of the inflated concerns of noisy, inner-city green groups.
 
 Even former Labor leader Bill Shorten criticised the government’s “go-slow” approach to approving major projects, saying on Twitter yesterday that the “ones who miss out are Australians in need of a secure job”.
 
 The interim report of the independent review of the EPBC Act, authored by Samuel and released on Monday, also rejected adding “climate change” as a trigger for the EPBC Act.
 
 The climate trigger, long a hobby horse of green activist groups, potentially would have ­required all greenhouse gas-­emitting projects to be approved by the federal environment minister. This would have constituted the de facto nationalisation of approvals for Australia’s resources, transport, agricultural and heavy industrial sectors and the dest­ruction of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
 
 Green groups also were expecting that the review would call for a federal government takeover of even more parts of environmental law. Instead, jobs again were put first and the report recommended more devolution and decentralisation of authority to state governments — a recommendation the government has already adopted.
 
 Ley said the government would pursue two bold reforms: to accredit state governments to carry out environmental assessments and approvals on the federal government’s behalf, and to explore market-based solutions to habitat rehabilitation.
 
 The move to accredited state governments will substantially reduce duplication and sometimes contradictory regulatory requirements between the state and federal governments, and signals a shift away from Canberra’s failed command-and-control approach to regulation.
 
 Seeking market-based reforms to environmental conservations, meanwhile, has long been advocated by organisations such as the government’s independent think tank, the Productivity Commission, to attain environmental outcomes with more flexibility and at less cost.
 
 For example, the commission noted in its 2016 Regulation of Australian Agriculture report that “better use could be made of market-based approaches to native vegetation and biodiversity conservation at times”.
 
 The fact these two initiatives were announced on the same day as the release of an interim, rather than final, report indicates that the government is starting to understand how important job creation will be to Australia’s recovery from the pandemic.
 
 Between March and June, 815,000 jobs had been lost because of the COVID-19 social distancing regulations introduced by federal and state governments. And while the official unemployment rate is 7.4 per cent, the real rate is 11.7 per cent once those who have on net left the labour market since March and those working zero hours are added.
 
 Young Australians have been affected disproportionably by the lockdown measures, with 355,000 15 to 24-year-olds not in full-time education and not working, the equivalent to 29.6 per cent. This is up from 22.3 per cent in March.
 
 Getting Australians back into work will be the most important factor in economic and social recovery. Mass unemployment is not only an economic problem, it is also a humanitarian tragedy.
 
 Work is the epicentre of a good and flourishing life. Those who work are more likely to own their own home, participate in their community and send their kids to good schools. They are also likely to have far superior physiological and psychological health outcomes, and are less likely to become dependent on drugs and ­alcohol, or to commit crimes and to be in jail.
 
 Losing your job because of coronavirus is one thing. But missing out on the dignity of work because a small group of inner-city, university-credentialed elitists look down on blue-collar jobs and manual labour is not who most Australians are.
 
 Parts of the interim report raise concerns. The suggestion that ­project actions “must deliver a net gain for critically endangered species habitat and ecological community distribution” is vague and inviting itself to be used as a mechanism for throwing spanners in the works, while the proposed adoption of federal government-enforced national environmental standards could result in a bureaucratic and lawyer-infested investment quagmire. These issues can be ironed out.
 
 By putting jobs for mainstream Australians ahead of the boutique concerns of noisy activists, the government has a unique opportunity to develop a much needed pro-worker and pro-jobs economic recovery strategy. Daniel Wild is director of research with the Institute of Public Affairs.",935
178,"Breaking the culture of dependency, entitlement",News,2021-12-18T03:45:48.530Z,"The Coalition’s reforms are working, but more are needed
 
 Maintaining a strong safety net for vulnerable individuals and families who are genuinely unable to support themselves is one of the tenets of our civilised society. At the same time, as we said in 2011: “Purposeful employment is fundamental to the self-worth and independence of everyone who is capable of undertaking it.” For that reason, and in the interests of budget repair, ensuring the safety net is affordable and preparing for the costs of supporting an ageing population, The Australian has championed major welfare reform for decades. Since 2013, the Coalition has shied away from the sweeping overhaul of welfare payments made by John Key’s government in New Zealand from 2008 to 2016. But figures released on Monday show the changes made in Australia since 2013 have been effective.
 
 In June last year, 13.5 per cent of citizens aged 16 to 64 were in receipt of a welfare payment. That proportion is lower than at any time since 1989 and lower than the 16.5 per cent when Tony Abbott won office. Under Paul Keating in 1994 the figure was 23.6 per cent and it nudged up to 24.4 per cent in 1996, John Howard’s first year as prime minister. By 2007, despite generous and widespread family payments, the Howard government had reduced the proportion of citizens in receipt of welfare to 17.2 per cent.
 
 The recent improvement, Families and Social Services Minister Anne Ruston said on Monday, arises from the strength of the labour market, which has seen 1.5 million jobs created on the Coalition’s watch since 2013. In December, employment ­data showed unemployment edging down to 5.1 per cent. And recent jobs growth has boosted the share of working-age people who have jobs to a record 74.5 per cent. While much of the growth has been in part-time work, underemployment — the sum of the unemployment rate and the percentage of employed workers who would like to work more hours — was steady in December at 8.3 per cent.
 
 The figures also underline the importance of Australia’s export industries. In Western Australia, for example, the end of the mining boom saw the number of welfare recipients increase by about 8000 to 210,730 over the five years to June last year.
 
 The statistics do not reveal the full picture of reform, however. One of the most important trends in recent years has been the shift to the Newstart Allowance (with a basic rate of $559 a fortnight, and an obligation to look for work) from the more generous Disability Support Pension ($850.40 a fortnight). Slowly but surely, reform has been achieved through successive ministers — including Labor ministers in the final years of the Rudd-Gillard era — tightening eligibility for the DSP. From a peak of 793,900 recipients in 2012, when Australians seemed to be unusually prone to bad backs, chronic fatigue, “crippling’’ stress, RSI, burnout and other ills, the number of DSP recipients fell to 680,300 in mid-2018. Reform was essential. A situation in which every 14 or 15 workers were supporting a disability support pensioner was no longer sustainable.
 
 On Thursday, we reported on a new, incremental reform to benefit 18,1200 humanitarian refugees arriving each year. With data showing 77 per cent of refugees were jobless a year after arriving — and 22 per cent still jobless after a decade — the government announced English-language courses for the newcomers would be overhauled under a push to settle half of new refugees in regional areas and help them find work. A new Refugee and Migrant Services Advisory Council, to be headed by refugee advocate Paris Aristotle, with ­private-sector business leaders on board, will attempt to drive better training and employment programs. The goal is to capitalise on the skills of refugees, some of whom are highly qualified, but who lack English-language skills. Such initiatives, implemented well, are needed to improve the quality of life for refugees and to boost skills in regional areas.The government’s welfare policies are on the right track, but it has no room for complacency. This financial year, social security and welfare spending will be $180bn. The outlay swallows a third of federal revenue and is more than defence and federal health and education spending combined.",739
179,Can we work towards a V-shaped educational recovery?,Others,2021-06-29T20:04:10.961Z,"Now that all school students have returned to class, we must tackle the hard part, reversing the educational decline due to unnecessary and prolonged school closures.
 
 The education penalty borne by students is plain to see. For most, home-based learning - despite the best efforts of teachers, parents, and students - has resulted in less learning time, over-reliance on independent study, demands on parental supervision, and ineffective technology use. All of which harms disadvantaged students most.
 
 Students disproportionately impacted are those outside the major cities, where digital readiness and capabilities of schools have lagged.
 
 There's also the white elephant in the room of unequal connectivity and bandwidth capacity for households across regional Australia despite the expensive NBN. Together, this has compounded existing city-country educational divides.
 
 Recovering this lost learning is achievable, but cannot be treated with complacency. A more coherent response will be needed from policymakers and schools.
 
 Priorities must be identifying students' learning gaps, assessing schools' pandemic responsiveness, ensuring flexible school funding to address identified needs, and constructively leveraging technology.
 
 Monitoring students' progress while learning at home has been exceedingly difficult, meaning teachers and schools are essentially flying blind. It's true they can use non-standardised ""formative assessments"" - judgments from informal classroom observations and interactions. But even at the best of times, those tools are prone to subjectively misdiagnosing students' true educational needs.
 
 Accountability has been put on hold with the scrapping of NAPLAN for this year. The premature abandonment of tests - originally scheduled for last month - means there's no standardised, objective, and comparable measure of students' learning in 2020.
 
 A learning diagnostic is needed now more than ever to triage the educational damage; particularly since students' progress will vary greatly from when teachers last tested them. A standardised test could provide teachers and schools an objective guide to where students are at and where to target remedial attention.
 
 The pandemic presents a rare window to compare schools' and teachers' practices - and even if students' learning has been hampered, there's plenty educators can learn from the experience.
 
 Part of the recovery effort must identify and stocktake the effectiveness of schools' COVID-19 responses and how resources have been spent.
 
 It hasn't taken long for usual, predictable lobbying for more school funding to aid the post-COVID educational rescue; with unwarranted calls for smaller classes, more teachers' aides, and overtime pay for teachers.
 
 One proposal is for additional ""catch-up funding"" to right the course, particularly using taxpayer money for expensive policy interventions backed by little evidence. Moreover, presumably this would be charged to the federal purse - meaning taxpayers in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory (where schools were closed only momentarily) would foot the bill for all the other states and territories (whose schools were stubbornly closed for up to nine weeks despite the consistent expert medical advice that it was safe for schools to remain open).
 
 In any case, existing funding is more than adequate for the task, with additional provisions already made to cover new COVID-related cleaning and hygiene expenses. Not to mention that monitoring and nurturing students' progress in core literacy and numeracy should be business-as-usual for schools, not cause for a financial windfall.
 
 What's needed is not more money, but more flexibility. Schools are confronted with vastly different challenges - since each has enjoyed varied success with home-based learning efforts - and need the autonomy to address them as they see fit.
 
 Those that target resources to support students most at risk will earn educational bang for those bucks.
 
 Technology must be part of the solution, not a scapegoat. It just needs to be used as intended: as a tool for students to practise applying concepts they know, rather than to acquire new knowledge. And as a supplement, rather than a substitute, for face-to-face teaching.
 
 We've belatedly flattened the curve on lost learning with the return to school. A V-shaped education recovery is possible, but there's no time to lose.

180,Celebrating the migrant mosaic,News,2020-07-27T11:16:20.042Z,"Chinese-Australians speak with a multiplicity of voices Graham Lloyd’s series on the ethnic Chinese in Australia is a compelling reminder that there is rarely such a thing as a monolithic migrant community. It’s true that the number of Chinese-born people living here began to increase rapidly not long before China under President Xi Jinping took on more chauvinistic and authoritarian features. But the Chinese presence in Australia has a long history and it is to be hoped that today’s troubles with Beijing prove to be a passing irritant and that mutual benefit will return as the bedrock of bilateral relations.
 
 Discovery of gold in the 1850s first attracted a sizeable number of Chinese with an adventurous spirit. After World War II the source of many ethnic Chinese arrivals was Southeast Asia. In the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square repression of 1989, the inflow of mainlanders, many with high levels of education, began to give the “Chinese Australian” demographic the considerable heft it has today. For most of this recent period, China was a good news story: a rewarding partner in trade and the key market for a lucrative inbound education industry.
 
 Now our economy suffers with pandemic, we are caught in a power struggle between China and the US, and some Chinese Australians are understandably anxious. There’s no doubt anti-Chinese racism is a strand in our history (think of the Lambing Flat Riots of 1861 and Federation’s White Australia policy), but multi-ethnic Australia has become a remarkably open and welcoming place. The history of the ethnic Chinese diaspora here is one of considerable success and achievement, and the wish to bring in family members remains strong.
 
 When racist incidents do occur, of course they require a decisive response. But exaggerating racism is recklessly counter-productive. Chinese authorities have tried to play the racism card to discourage international students, to punish Australia economically and to distract attention from their attempts to exert political influence within our sovereign borders. This goes back several years, at least as far back as 2008 when Beijing organised students to frustrate pro-Tibet protests during the Olympic torch relay in Canberra. More recently, attempts to control Chinese community organisations and to interfere in our party politics have been well documented. There is evidence of several ethnic Chinese — not all Australian citizens — enabling this strategy. Some appear unabashed partisans of the Chinese Communist Party, others convince themselves that alignment with Beijing’s interests in truth serves Australia’s future.
 
 Those outside the Chinese diaspora should remember the pressures that apply. Attachment to China as a mother country (as opposed to the regime) does not make anyone less Australian. But there is a darker side. The party leadership has updated its authoritarianism with surveillance technology and is willing to punish mainland families for the dissent of relatives abroad. Mr Xi’s chauvinism implies that all ethnic Chinese, regardless of birthplace or legal nationality, owe a higher duty to the party as the custodian of Chineseness. Given the risks they face, the significant number of Chinese Australians who defy Beijing and stand up for democracy and human rights are all the more heroic. Their courage and connections are vital for Australia to maintain its independent policy.
 
 They are living proof that the CCP does not own Chinese people, their culture or their ancient civilisation. And some of today’s clearest, most urgent expressions of liberalism — ideas fostered in the West but with broad appeal — have come from democracy activists in Hong Kong. China certainly has its own authoritarian traditions but, for many Chinese, Leninist totalitarianism is an import destructive of Chinese values. Hence the astonishment when the party that requires family members to inform on each other attempted to co-opt Confucianism. But beyond any tribal politics, it’s vital to keep in mind that as a pluralistic society, Australia gives both the locally born and recent arrivals the freedom to develop as individuals with views and opinions beyond the supposed party line of any imagined subculture.",682
181,Challenges ahead on mental health,Fairfax,2021-07-04T07:45:19.498Z,"The Age's View
 
 T here is no doubting the scale of the problem. Even before the pandemic struck, the inadequacies of our mental health systems were evident. And like many fault lines in our society, this year has only further exposed and deepened them. The evidence and warnings are almost daily. A recent report by the Victorian Agency for Health Information revealed a more than 70 per cent increase from last year in the number of serious self-harm and suicidal-ideation presentations in emergency departments for those aged under 18 during the final six weeks of lockdown. That is a shocking figure.
 
 This week the long-anticipated Productivity Commission report into mental health found mental ill-health and suicide in Australia costs the nation at least $200 billion a year. And in a damning assessment of the mental health system in place, it found that up to half of those who died by suicide had not interacted with the mental health system in the months leading up to their deaths.
 
 Victoria's first mental health system, the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum, opened in 1848. While the Lunacy Act of 1867 was the state's first of many attempts to set down in law the structures and rules of a mental health system, public outcry over the treatment of those in asylums soon led to a royal commission.
 
 It beggars belief that we are still in that situation today. The Andrews government's royal commission into mental health is still at work, but its interim report made clear that years of chronic under-investment in the sector led to a system that ""catastrophically failed to live up to expectations"".
 
 In a pre-budget announcement, the state government pledged $870 million to begin to implement some of the royal commission's recommendations. The multimillion-dollar package includes almost $500 million for 120 extra mental health beds, and more funding for extra acute treatment beds for mental health patients in public and private hospital. It's a good start, but it is only a start.
 
 What the royal commission and the Productivity Commission make evident is that throwing money at the problem will make a difference, but it must be done in a way that accepts the reality that the system is in need of a root-and-branch rethink. That will require a bipartisan commitment to a shared vision of reform over many years.
 
 While the worst of the pandemic is hopefully now behind us in Victoria, for some people employment will not return for many months, or even years, career and study plans will be thwarted, relationships damaged and social connections irrevocably disrupted. These all have consequences, and not just financial ones.
 
 Australian society will not return to normal just because the GDP figures head back into more positive territory. It is an enormous challenge for governments. Despite much work by many to make it a topic of public discussion and understanding, there is still a long way to go. So often it is an underlying issue for those incarcerated, living in poverty or homelessness, or suffering from a drug addiction. The pandemic is only going to exacerbate these problems.
 
 There has been much talk about how society will change after the pandemic, whether it be how we work, shop, engage with each other, to what issues people will care about. The lockdowns taught us that, under stress, managing one's mental health is an absolute essential. It does appear that governments are now fully committed to putting in place the services required to offer the support for people to do just that.",611
182,Chinese Australians' key role in virus fight,Fairfax,2020-10-31T16:36:50.638Z,"The nation has pulled together to face the myriad challenges posed by coronavirus, which is why it was so important this week for Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call out those targeting Chinese Australians.
 
 The 1.2 million-strong community has been the target of slurs, vandalism and even physical attacks. ""COVID-19 China Die"" was spray painted on the house of a Chinese family in the Melbourne suburb of Knoxville on Monday; a Chinese Australian councillor in the South Australian city of Salisbury was spat at by a passer-by who blamed her for the pandemic; and the Australian Human Rights Commission has reported that about a quarter of the complaints it received in February and March were from Asians with similar stories.
 
 A group of 16 Chinese Australians, including Age contributors Benjamin Law and Adam Liaw, penned an open letter this month warning this racial vilification posed a threat to national unity. The letter has received bipartisan support from ALP senator Penny Wong and Liberal senator Andrew Bragg. Another 30,000 have signed the petition.
 
 It should go without saying that Chinese Australians are not to blame for the pandemic or for the mistakes the Chinese Communist Party undoubtedly made in January when it failed to control the spread of the virus. Yet a number of other unfortunate claims are sometimes made that should be challenged. Some mistakenly blame Chinese people returning from visits home for spreading the virus here.
 
 Mr Morrison put the record straight on Tuesday when he said Chinese Australians were ""one of the greatest defences we had in those early weeks"".
 
 ""They were the ones who first went into self-isolation,"" Mr Morrison added. ""They were the ones who were returning from family visits up into China ... and it was through their care, it was through their commitment, their patience that actually Australia was protected in their first wave. And I think that is the view of all Australians. So we have to call that sort of thing out.""
 
 The numbers confirm that the growth of the virus was relatively contained in February. Numbers rose sharply in March because of travellers returning from the US and Europe, as well as government mismanagement of cruise ship arrivals. Those groups did more to spread the disease in Australia. In the early days of the crisis some circulated a rumour that a bus load of Chinese Australians had travelled to country towns and panic bought supplies. It was never confirmed, and in any case panic buying was widespread and certainly not confined to one ethnic group.
 
 Unfortunately, some politicians overseas have spoken loosely about the coronavirus in a way that encourages prejudice. US President Donald Trump has been among the worst, referring to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus"".
 
 The Age has repeatedly raised concerns about the activities of the CCP's United Front Work Department, which hounds critics of its poor human rights record and policies on Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang. This masthead will also continue to report on Beijing's expanding influence in the region, including foreign interference activities, without fear or favour.
 
 This geopolitical tension is likely to grow, particular as US authority weakens under Trump. But the CCP's failings can never become an excuse for prejudice against our vibrant Chinese-Australian community.",560
183,"Clear, strong policies needed to take racism out of the game",Others,2021-05-13T21:10:52.699Z,"A FL football is again leading the way in efforts to stamp out racism and the vision of players kneeling before games has sent a clear message about their thoughts on the issue.
 
 Fremantle went a step further and refunded a membership after one of their fans declared he would hand it back if the Dockers took a knee in Brisbane.
 
 With thousands of people marching in support of the Black Lives Matter campaign, it is obvious that broader society wants change. And that’s why the AFL needs to change its own racial vilification policy to eradicate such vilification from the field, the grandstands and social media.
 
 When it comes to racial vilification, players shouldn’t be protected by confidentiality agreements in 2020.
 
 A player who is racially abused shouldn’t be required to sit through mediation and make a decision about whether his abuser deserves a greater penalty.
 
 The policy of eradicating racism through education was important when Michael Long stood up to Damian Monkhorst in 1995.
 
 But today’s players and fans — at AFL, state league and community level — have had long enough to understand racism is unacceptable.
 
 In the event of an incident occurring on the field, instead of a confidential complaint being issued to start a process that is designed to avoid public disclosure, the policy should guarantee a clear public penalty that plants actions alongside symbolism.
 
 It is unlikely an AFL player would transgress in the current environment.
 
 We only have to look at the significant fallout that NFL star Drew Brees experienced in his own locker room when he made ignorant comments in recent weeks to know that losing the respect of teammates is a severe punishment.
 
 But if nobody finds out, that punishment doesn’t really exist.
 
 It is more likely that racism will occur on the field at lower levels and the threat of public disclosure instead of mediation would make a player think twice about attacking someone.
 
 A clear policy towards members or fans who make comments in the grandstand or through social media would further underpin steps forward. Clubs have been superb in their efforts to remove racism among fans.
 
 Several clubs have cancelled memberships for comments made at games or through social media.
 
 But when incidents happen, everyone should know the penalty for being racist. Make it clear. Put in on paper.
 
 The symbolism of kneeling together is a big statement. But significantly strengthening the racial vilification rules would be a much bigger step.

184,Compelling story shines a light,News,2021-04-22T09:35:39.505Z,"Abuse within families has been in the shadows for too long Silence. Secrecy. Shame. These are the weapons of the monsters hiding under our children’s beds. Don’t tell anyone. This is our little secret, or everyone will know you’ve done something wrong. Everyone will know you are dirty.
 
 On Saturday we publish a searing piece of journalism: the first-person account by writer Virginia Tapscott of the sexual abuse she and her elder sister, Alexandra Tapp, endured as children at the hands of their step-grandfather, now dead. Tapscott, 29, is driven by righteous fury — not only at what happened but also at the depth of trauma and despair that drove Alex to overdose on drugs in June at the age of just 33. Alex confided in her sister that she had been raped at the age of 18 by another man, also a close male relative. Neither perpetrator has been held to account. Nor have thousands just like them: the adults who prey on children, safe in the knowledge they’ll never be caught because this is a subject our society just doesn’t like to talk about.
 
 In our age of openness, child sex abuse is one of the last taboos. The great social change of the late 20th and early 21st centuries is the advent of understanding that children have rights: to be free from violence and to have their voices heard. We’ve become familiar, thanks to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, with the accounts of children who were abused in institutions such as orphanages. But abuse within families is still in the shadows. Child sexual abuse cases are notoriously hard to prosecute because victims typically are too afraid or isolated to speak up until many years have passed, by which time perpetrators are often dead.
 
 Victims are constrained, too, by the fear of upsetting the people they love, of fracturing the whole family. Those victims who do make it to a police station confront the stark fact that evidence — the kind of evidence needed to convince a jury beyond reasonable doubt — is often non-existent: contemporaneous accounts, diary entries, disclosures to teachers or sports coaches, medical records. That’s precisely because children in abusive households have nowhere to go; nobody to tell. When a perpetrator has parental authority and physical control of a victim, help is out of reach. If a case by some miracle does make it to trial, a defence barrister will make much of this lack of evidence and suggest the complainant is making it all up. Again, it comes down to the victim’s word against the perpetrator’s. And each time a victim is disbelieved, the message is sent out again to all the other victims: nobody wants to know. Tapscott has had enough of shame. She won’t be silent for one more second. She wants us all to talk about this scourge, to listen to the stories of those who haven’t been believed and to break the spell of secrecy once and for all.",521
185,Coronavirus risk more than biological,Fairfax,2021-11-14T12:40:45.797Z,"In Stephen Soderbergh's 2011 film Contagion, a mysterious virus originating in Macau ripples through the United States. What follows is a bubbling concoction of state anxiety, pandemic imagery and looming societal collapse.
 
 The emergence of a new coronavirus in central China, termed ""2019-nCoV"", has dampened Lunar New Year celebrations in the country and sparked memories of SARS, which spread to more than two dozen countries, including Australia, and infected thousands in 2003.
 
 Images of Chinese people in masks are saturating the TV news. Apocalyptic imagery and headlines have foreshadowed a global health emergency, although the World Health Organisation is yet to declare one.
 
 Meanwhile, the death toll is on the rise, cities are in lockdown and Australians consume daily updates indicating the number of people being tested for the virus on our shores. Authorities have confirmed that, so far, three people have tested positive in NSW and one in Victoria.
 
 Reporting of the virus latches on to a double anomaly: the fear, speculation and uncertainty inherent in the spread of new diseases, as well as a fascination with the darkened interiors of China - a country which continues to evade mainstream literacy in Australia and whose size and scale conjure fantasy at every turn.
 
 But a disease of Soderbergh's imagination has not hit Australian shores - at least, not yet. For now, another threat is closer to home.
 
 History tells us that disease and discrimination are two sides of the same coin. The Ebola outbreak perpetuated images of the ""Dark Continent"" and exacerbated existing patterns of xenophobia towards black communities. ""Disease and disorder"" in Africa was forcibly contrasted with the civilised West's obsession with ""health and hierarchy."" In the 1980s, when Haitian communities in America were labelled a risk group for AIDS, they suffered myriad economic and social harms, including being barred from donating blood. When SARS spread to Toronto, Chinese-Canadians were refused taxi rides, their businesses were boycotted and community leaders said racial tensions increased palpably.
 
 Pathogens may not discriminate, but societies certainly do.
 
 There have already been calls by prominent Twitter users to extend Trump's travel ban to include all of China. ""Oh for pete's sake! The Supreme Court upheld your Muslim ban, @realDonaldTrump. Would you please put a temporary travel ban on China?"" tweeted conservative pundit Ann Coulter, who boasts 2.2 million followers.
 
 Some media reports have referred to coronavirus as the ""China virus"", or ""Chinese virus"" in shorthand. Reporting like this racialises the disease and allows the risk of a disease to be conflated with the risk to minority groups, allowing them to be singled out as second-class citizens.
 
 Minority groups become portrayed as carriers of the disease and something foreign and alien. They are left more visible and vulnerable to racial profiling, discrimination and marginalisation as a result.
 
 The coronavirus should be treated seriously. As with all matters of public health, how we respond to it will not be simply a test of Australia's public health infrastructure. It will also be a test of our values.

186,Courts need to get tougher on sex abuse,Fairfax,2020-10-28T23:18:13.111Z,"Powerful and profound changes have been generated by the royal commission that in recent years examined thousands of instances of sexual abuse of children in Australian institutions. Not the least is a more comprehensive understanding of the insidious nature of child sexual abuse and the devastating impact it can have That understanding is influencing the community's response to complaints and the structure of judicial processes. Among the commission's many recommendations were practical proposals for reforming the criminal justice system to improve prospects for complainants in child sexual abuse cases. This included suggestions for lowering what are, in effect, some very high hurdles on the way to proving allegations against offenders.
 
 While the royal commission was preparing its final report in mid-2017, the High Court was considering some of these issues in a case involving Robert Lindsay Hughes, the actor convicted in the NSW District Court in 2014 over sex offences against five children. The question at issue in the High Court involved the use of so-called tendency and coincidence evidence, sometimes called similar-fact or propensity evidence. This is evidence showing a defendant had a tendency to engage or, indeed, had engaged previously in certain misconduct and was therefore likely to do so again.
 
 In the Hughes case, the High Court noted that the NSW and Victorian courts of appeal had reached different conclusions about what kind of tendency evidence could be admissible. In a submission to the High Court, the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions supported the broader approach adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in NSW, which did not require the specific acts to be necessarily similar. The High Court found 4-3 in favour of the NSW approach.
 
 Two months later, the royal commission urged legislators to abolish common law principles or rules that restricted the use of similar-fact or propensity evidence. It also recommended allowing prosecutors to use evidence of a defendant's prior convictions or charges (except if acquitted) in relation to child sexual assaults. Last week, the NSW government made the first move to amend its legislation, and Victoria is expected to follow. One consequence is that allegations involving multiple complainants against a single defendant could be aggregated into a single trial.
 
 Tendency or coincidence evidence has always been a highly contentious area of law, particularly in cases involving child sexual abuse. The secrecy, confusion and fear inflicted on abused children means these crimes are often not reported for many years, by which time the best evidence available might amount to one word against another. When paedophiles stridently deny such allegations and the victim is left to explain in excruciating detail the abuse that happened, juries (or a judge) must decide whom to believe.
 
 That places the child complainant in an invidious position. As ABC's Four Corners revealed recently, a 15-year-old St Kevin's College schoolboy, Paris Street, was required to endure two days of intense cross-examination in a case involving Peter Kehoe, an athletics coach who made criminal sexual approaches. Kehoe was found guilty of grooming - and ended up with a non-custodial, community corrections order.
 
 Every day, somewhere in Australia, there are rigorous and traumatising cross-examinations of children or adults making historical sexual abuse complaints. The challenge commonly made by the defence is that the child invented the whole thing or misinterpreted the perpetrator's actions. Proof of previous misconduct can go a long way to undermining that line of defence. Moves to ease the burden on victims are welcome and necessary. At the same time, courts should not underestimate how profoundly community expectations have changed in terms of sentencing. In short, courts need to get tougher.
 
 The public sees sentences for child sex offences as too light, and it gets a confused signal when courts grant groomers - as with the case of Kehoe - non-custodial, community corrections orders.",658

 First, don't use this crisis as a licence to increase the size of government permanently. Or, to paraphrase the late and great American columnist Charles Krauthammer, we agree to suspend the invisible hand of Adam Smith during a pandemic - but not in order to be crushed by the heavy hand of government in the recovery.
 
 Indeed, the large and massive expansion of the state in response to the COVID-19 shock represents a temporary state of affairs. Once the pandemic passes, it will be the right thing for responsible leaders to do everything to ensure a true return to normal, and to manage expectations as sensibly as possible.
 
 Otherwise, as my Centre for Independent Studies colleague Robert Carling warns: ""JobKeeper becomes JobKiller because it stifles incentives and keeps resources bottled up in unproductive activities or in businesses that have no future.""
 
 That is why the government has tapered and targeted the revamped income-support measures as recovery develops.
 
 Second, liberate what John Maynard Keynes called the economy's ""animal spirits"" - the passions and competitive instincts essential to economic growth. Why not slash costly regulations that impede job creation? Modernise our enterprise bargaining workplace system to drive wages through productivity gains. Use the tax system to encourage entrepreneurship among younger Australians?
 
 Third, resist the temptation to increase business or income taxation. The former will drive successful people abroad and restrict business incentive to invest in innovation; the latter will stifle talent and enterprise and deter people who exist on welfare from seeking to re-enter the workplace.
 
 As unfashionable as it is to say, nations can't tax themselves back to full employment. Jobs and growth are not created by state paternalistic power, but by private enterprises free to invest and innovate by being taxed and regulated less.
 
 Fourth, recognise the limits to borrowing. Conventional wisdom holds that the huge debt is manageable because, in a world of very low interest rates and low inflation, governments can just rely on cheap money.
 
 However, a higher debt burden increases our vulnerability to future economic shocks and reduces the government's flexibility in responding to them. The stimulus spending that leads to rising debt might help us weather the present shock, but it's not a sound basis for long-lasting recovery, never mind the wasteful spending that distorts incentives and diverts resources from more productive uses.
 
 Supporters of increased government debt say as long as the economy grows at a rate in excess of the interest rate, the burden of the debt will fall. Perhaps. However, high growth rates and low interest rates are not guaranteed in coming years. Without a broad reform agenda that sharpens incentives to create wealth, future generations will pay for the high debt load with crippling taxation and a much-devalued currency.
 
 Fifth, defend the market economy. No matter how much nonsense is spouted about capitalism, remember this recession is the result of government policies to stem the spread the virus. It has nothing to do with the ""neo-liberal"" reforms of the Hawke-Keating-Howard eras that helped spur almost 30 years of unbroken growth with low inflation, low unemployment and, according to the Productivity Commission, no great widening in inequality.
 
 Nor is it the result of a shrinking state: for more than a decade, government spending on health and education as a percentage of GDP has increased.
 
 History shows that markets are responsible for lifting so many people out of poverty and improving living standards. By linking effort with reward, the market economy creates wealth. Without wealth creation, there is no scope for the taxation that enables the functions society demands: education, health, welfare, defence, a public broadcaster and so on.
 
 I readily acknowledge that in the current climate these suggestions won't suddenly convert readers to the cause of fiscal discipline and economic reform. ""Just as there are no atheists on a sinking ship, there are no free marketeers during a pandemic,"" says the esteemed British writer-broadcaster Jonathan Freedland. Fair point.
 
 However, there will come a day when governments need to exercise fiscal constraint and put in place productivity-enhancing policies to grow the economy. If they don't, then the coming years could be grim beyond belief, with terrible consequences for each and every one of us.

188,Deadly gang hatred needs real response,News,2021-08-27T16:23:02.497Z,"MELBOURNE’S gang crisis is an ugly reality the State Government and Victoria Police command can no longer ignore. It shouldn’t take the murder of an innocent teenager for authorities to address an issue that they’d rather not name.
 
 Solomone “Solo” Taufeulungaki was a wonderful young man with a beaming smile who loved his family, church and rugby. What happened to him in a suburban shopping centre carpark on Tuesday afternoon shames an entire city.
 
 How can we count our home city as among the world’s most liveable when a 15-year-old is not safe walking home from school? Solo had no chance after being set upon by a gang of up to 10 armed youngsters metres from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints where his family gathers on Sundays.
 
 Solo’s death comes six months after 17-year-old Aguer Akech was fatally stabbed in a violent clash involving gangs of youths at Keilor Plains railway station. Last month a teenager from Tarneit, who had been arrested and released nine times in a matter of months, was charged with Akech’s murder.
 
 We can’t pretend we weren’t warned. In recent years we’ve seen gang violence break out from St Kilda to Footscray to Taylors Hill to Hoppers Crossing. Only last week police, speaking off the record, warned about the rise in gang crime in Melbourne’s northwest.
 
 Carjackings, home invasions, snatch-and-grab robberies are among the crimes linked to gangs in the past year. Most of Melbourne’s street gangs have a defined ethnic identity though some have members from diverse backgrounds.
 
 Replacing the likes of Apex and Menace To Society are gangs such as Blood Drill Kill, HP Boys, the Brotherhood, Black Belly Gang, 97, Westside and STG.
 
 For years we’ve seen the upper echelons of Victoria Police deny the existence of a gang problem despite officers working at the coalface readily admitting the problem is real and growing. Who can forget in 2018 Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton simultaneously announcing the formation of an “African-Australian community taskforce” to tackle youth crime and street violence while rubbishing suggestions there was an African gang crisis?
 
 Victoria Police’s aversion to the word gangs — they prefer “a collective group of individuals who know each other” — has seen police command indulge in spin and semantics instead of tackling the problem head on.
 
 The two most recent gang-related murders of teenagers do not appear to be motivated by racial hatreds but that animosity does exist.
 
 Western suburbs youth worker Maria Kumer warned tensions between the Sudanese community and Pacific Islander community were likely to lead to more violence.
 
 “They have this hate for one another, I don’t think they really know themselves why this is brewing,” Ms Kumer said.
 
 “It’s a territorial thing between the two cultures, one wants to be better than one another. There is bad blood between the Sudanese and Pacific Islander young people. Just bad blood. It has to be addressed.” Where do these racial hatreds come from and why are race-obsessed activists disinterested in the violence afflicting these communities?
 
 It seems if the perpetrator is not white, the victim does not matter. Every life is precious, not just the ones activists use to push a dishonest political agenda.
 
 FREEDOM TO TRAVEL A SCARED populace is a subservient one. Australians have dutifully obeyed every new law and restriction that strips away our personal freedoms in the name of public safety. Now, we are told we cannot travel overseas until 2021.
 
 Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham said Australia’s borders were likely to remain closed until the end of the year with travel overseas “quite some distance off”.
 
 Of course that doesn’t preclude international students coming to Australia from next month but for the rest of us we are living on a “prison island’’ with no chance of escape.
 
 Why aren’t civil libertarians taking to the streets and demanding our rights be fully restored?
 
 Dud modelling predicting thousands of Australian deaths, even with all the restrictions that have been imposed, has shown to be about as reliable as a chocolate teapot yet we are still being guilted into submission with livelihood-destroying restrictions.
 
 Surely Australians should be able to decide for themselves whether they want to risk a plane trip overseas. The government can impose a requirement for 14 days of quarantine upon re-entry but it should not be restricting people’s ability to travel.
 
 South Korea has shown you can effectively monitor those who return from overseas through tracking apps and regular follow ups.
 
 Australia has seen mass protests throughout the country that break every crowd and social-distancing rule but law-abiding individuals are subjected to draconian constraints that prevent them from making decisions about their own welfare.

189,DEFECTS IN JOBS FOR ALL,News,2021-01-15T15:26:14.949Z,"The private sector must be free to drive our recovery Of course the best form of welfare is a job, but that’s no justification for governments to permanently underwrite labour markets.
 
 The pandemic’s economic carnage has understandably heightened concern over employment prospects — especially for young workers and those displaced from industries facing an uncertain future. This has seen the government increasingly urged to make JobKeeper … a keeper.
 
 Agitators also claim there’s a need to sustain the elevated payment levels of JobKeeper and JobSeeker — citing prolonged shutdowns in Victoria, which have hiked demand for the wage subsidy. The rates of both payments are being tapered.
 
 The scheme has offered critical support in uncertain times. But the longer it persists, the more it undermines the private sector-led recovery. And a stronger private sector will pull our economy out of the corona doldrums — not a stronger welfare handout.
 
 Some have warmed to increased government activism in labour markets, seeing the temporary wage subsidy as forerunner to more enduring and ambitious intervention.
 
 The most disconcerting proposal is for a job guarantee — an unconditional and universally available job offer, funded by the federal government — to replace traditional unemployment benefits (at far greater expense).
 
 But there could be no greater economic albatross to sabotage recovery. It’s a post-Keynesian nonsense that all citizens are “entitled” to a job, and that such responsibility lies with government. Together with the “modern monetary theory”, it is seen by some as the game-changer for radical ideas.
 
 Proponents say that “meaningful” work would be made available to all, with recipients earning the equivalent of the minimum wage (higher than the tapered JobKeeper and considerably higher than regular unemployment payments), and resulting in a more productive and skilled workforce.
 
 They also argue this would reduce “inherent instability” in market economies — since, in theory, a jobs guarantee would be counter-cyclical (cushioning the private sector void in labour demand in downturns, and vice versa).
 
 But even with the most sympathetic reading, a jobs guarantee is still the wrong prescription to the pandemic-hit labour market.
 
 While jobs may well be created, almost as many will be destroyed, since government crowds out private employers. Why would the private sector compete with a permanently underwritten government provider?
 
 What’s worse is that even if there were jobs to be created, this will only be via “busy work”, of little value to the wider economy.
 
 Moreover, it means there’s little prospect those in guaranteed jobs will become equipped with marketable skills to gain private sector employment — further entrenching welfare dependency.
 
 And the productivity-draining effects are inescapable; for those in guaranteed jobs, as well as those in comparable ones.
 
 First, with any universal job guarantee, work must be offered to even the most unskilled (and unmotivated) — those with little incentive to upskill and improve private sector employability. And guaranteed job security would blunt performance incentives, as well as the reallocation of workers to meet demand.
 
 The productivity drain will also be felt more broadly, with low-skilled workers attracted to guaranteed jobs. Why remain in the private sector where there’s a threat of dismissal?
 
 By failing to genuinely create jobs, the scheme just becomes a more expensive, and less effective, form of welfare — with even weaker incentives for training. And by stalling productivity, the private sector becomes less vibrant when we need it to spring back to life.
 
 The government must keep tapering the JobKeeper scheme and set the course for retracting this unprecedented intervention into the economy. The recovery can be supported only through the unleashing of markets — not the permanent expansion of government — in resurrecting jobs.
 
 The only guarantee of a jobs guarantee is that it will make a sick economy terminal. Glenn Fahey is research fellow at the Centre for Independent Studies.",645
190,Disabled must not bear cost of hit to budget surplus,Fairfax,2020-06-03T11:26:07.768Z,"The unexpected slowdown in the economy from the coronavirus outbreak and the summer bushfires will pose a serious challenge to the economic management credentials of the Morrison government in coming months.
 
 It is still too early to know how bad the pain will be but it is already clear that it will be harder than expected for Prime Minister Scott Morrison to deliver on his promise of a budget surplus this financial year.
 
 Rebuilding after the fires will cost billions and universities, casinos and airlines are warning about the loss of Chinese tourists and students.
 
 The data out this week on the economy was not encouraging. Unemployment jumped to 5.3 per cent in January from 5.1 per cent and wages in the December quarter showed no sign of growing in line with budget forecasts.
 
 The budget surplus was expected to be $5 billion when the federal government released its mid-yearly economic and fiscal outlook in December.
 
 However, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg this week admitted the vista is grim, saying events outside his control had adversely affected the budget bottom line.
 
 There are some bright spots, especially the high price of iron ore exports which allowed BHP and Fortescue Mining to report bumper profits this week, generating tax revenue for the federal budget.
 
 But it looks like the PM and Mr Frydenberg might come under pressure to defer the promise of returning to surplus. Alternatively, they might try to find ways to scrape into the black and honour their promise by resorting to a mixture of spending cuts and revenue rises.
 
 Given this complex fiscal situation, the Herald is concerned that the government will take the cynical path of cutting spending on those least able to complain in order to meet its target.
 
 That seems to be what it has done in delaying a payment of as much as $1.6 billion from a ""reserve fund"" to help the states meet the costs of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
 
 As the Herald reported, the responsible ministers of Victoria and NSW have written to Federal NDIS Minister Stuart Robert complaining that even though the government promised the funds would be available from this financial year, they have just been told not to expect the money until after the budget in May.
 
 It is significant that both the NSW Coalition government and the Victorian ALP government are worried about the budget surplus being prioritised ahead of the needs of the disabled, because the federal government can't claim it's a partisan political tactic.
 
 NSW Disability Services Minister Gareth Ward says this must not be a case where people with disabilities are short-changed to balance the budget. The Herald agrees.
 
 Mr Robert denies the Herald's reports, saying the reserve is designed to provide financial stability to the NDIS and was not intended as a cash pot for the states.
 
 Rather than blaming the states, Mr Robert should
 
 be trying to look for a way to spend the money and break
 
 the logjam.
 
 The NDIS is a unique scheme launched six years ago which funds people with a disability to choose their service providers based on personalised plans.
 
 But it has been dogged by federal government red tape.
 
 In the last budget the government revealed it had spent
 
 $4.6 billion less than budgeted.
 
 A review by former senior public servant David Tune released last month said people are angry and frustrated by how hard it is to work with the NDIS and about 200,000 eligible people are still not signed up.
 
 The new reserve fund is supposed to help states deliver services faster. Yet the federal government has simply stalled discussion of the details and is sitting on the cash. Disabled people are the losers.
 
 The money needs to start flowing without delay.
 
 There might be some mixed messages from senior government figures about the budget surplus, natural disaster recovery spending and the hit to revenues following the coronavirus outbreak.
 
 But delivering a surplus by dudding the NDIS would set a worrying precedent.",688
191,Diversity is not a priority,News,2021-06-22T21:37:10.090Z,"I WOULD thank the lunatic Victorian government for making my critics look stupid, if it wasn’t that so many people have died.
 
 Two months ago I was savaged by the mob for saying this second wave of infections “exposes the stupi­dity of that multicultural slogan ‘diversity makes us stronger’”.
 
 I said diversity had instead weakened us.
 
 I won’t go through all my evidence: how the virus was worst in the most multicultural suburbs, housing commission towers, workplaces and an Islamic school, after slipping out of quarantine hotels where many guards were immigrant workers, badly trained.
 
 Nor will I go through the admissions by the Victorian government that public health messages were not reaching ethnic groups where English was poor.
 
 Let me instead point out even more evidence – crazy stuff – that’s come out since activists said they’d ask the Press Council to punish me for my heresy.
 
 Last week, a public servant working in Victoria’s highly infectious quarantine hotels told an inquiry he’d been given an hour of training in “equity and diversity”, but none on personal protective equipment.
 
 I don’t think this is an anomaly. The self-destructive preaching of “diversity” seems to run through what should have been a war to stop the virus.
 
 About 90 per cent of infections in this second wave have been traced back to a hotel where security was handed to Unified Security, which was not a preferred tenderer but did boast it was “Indigenous-owned”. And it seems the government hasn’t learned its lesson.
 
 See its ads now for a manager and several policy officers for its COVID-19 Forward Strategy and Co-ordination Branch.
 
 In the nine-paragraph job descriptions, there are four paragraphs stressing the branch’s commitment to diversity, and not one to its commitment to stopping people getting sick.
 
 It declares: “We’re building an inclusive workplace that embraces diversity of backgrounds and differences”, and “we encourage job applications from Aboriginal people, people with disabilities, LGBTI and people from culturally diverse backgrounds”.
 
 Only later is there one fleeting reference to what should be the most urgent part of the job: “the development of policy advice on measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19”. But for all this yammer about “diversity”, what happened? A second wave that’s hit the most “diverse” communities worst.",402
192,Don't play tricks with the NDIS,Fairfax,2021-08-14T10:16:58.031Z,"No one expected it would be easy to set up the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but it has been going for six years and it is still far too difficult to use for people who need its services. That is the fundamental conclusion of a federal government review - released yesterday - by retired senior public servant David Tune on why the NDIS is still not fulfilling its promise. The scheme is fantastic when it works. A uniquely Australian approach, it pays for services which allow people with a disability to function in society based on a personalised plan. It also cuts down on bureaucratic delays and expense because participants can choose their provider.
 
 The NDIS now works with more than 300,000 people. That includes about 100,000 who were previously receiving no support at all. Another 200,000 or so who were enrolled in various state and federal programs have now transitioned to the NDIS and are receiving far more help than before. Yet many of those already signed up for the scheme are receiving only a fraction of what they need, and about 200,000 more people with a permanent and significant disability have still not been able to use the system at all. The red tape makes it too hard for people with a disability, especially the most vulnerable, to sign up for the scheme and it takes too long to secure approval for basic equipment such as wheelchairs.
 
 As The Age has reported in recent days, before even signing up for the scheme, let alone receiving assistance, the wait can be six to nine months. Hundreds of people are dying waiting for their file to be stamped. Mr Tune says people are frustrated, dissatisfied and angry. Successive ministers have paid lip service to the scheme, but a lack of enthusiasm has been evident. This became screamingly obvious last year after the federal government revealed that in 2018-2019 it spent $4.6 billion less on the NDIS than was allocated in the budget. This was a sign of administrative failure, either by accident or neglect, to get the system working.
 
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has a close family member with a serious disability, has said making the NDIS work will be one of his top priorities. He has, for the first time, carved out the NDIS into a standalone portfolio under Government Services Minister Stuart Roberts. There is some evidence that in the past six months the federal government has committed more resources to some of these problems and the waiting lines appear to be getting shorter.
 
 But the report's recommendations must be implemented. Previous reviews, which raised similar issues, did not elicit a sufficiently strong response from decision-makers.
 
 Some of the changes could be straightforward and inexpensive, others complicated and costly. They include imposing legal limits on waiting times for handling applications to the NDIS and speeding up the process of creating personalised care plans. The government must also spend big on IT to help people understand their rights and track where they are in the system.
 
 A key problem is the need to train about 90,000 specialised workers as the NDIS grows. There is already a chronic shortage. Given the weak economy and the costs of the drought and bushfires, the government is under pressure to save cash so it can deliver on its promise of a budget surplus. But it must not play tricks with the NDIS. It should implement the Tune report in full.",594
193,Fairness is another casualty,News,2020-12-26T05:31:26.429Z,"ONE of the things I love about Australia is our egalitarian ethos — a country where we say “mate”, not “sir”, where we don’t have private areas on beaches, and where we don’t leap to our feet when the Prime Minister enters the room. Yet it is increasingly under threat.
 
 When coronavirus hit, the Australian government followed other nations in implementing JobKeeper, the most expensive program in our history. It’s also the most effective. Labour economists estimate JobKeeper saved 700,000 to 900,000 jobs.
 
 To keep the connection between firms and workers, JobKeeper was paid to companies. Most firms did the right thing with the money. But not all. Some paid executive bonuses or paid out big dividends, benefiting billionaire shareholders.
 
 It ain’t fair. JobKeeper was meant to save the jobs of battlers, not line the pockets of billionaires. If your firm is getting taxpayer assistance, the boss shouldn’t be getting a bonus, and shareholders shouldn’t be getting a stonking dividend.
 
 Some rewarded the top and penalised the bottom (what I call the Downton Abbey Effect). For example, retailer Accent Group received $13m in JobKeeper and gave its CEO a $1.2m bonus. But in stores, it was a different story.
 
 An employee of one of Accent Group’s brands wrote to me: “Yes, the company has kept employees on the books, but it doesn’t mean everyone got shifts. Casuals not on JobKeeper — managers were told not to roster them when we reopened unless desperate … we ran understaffed and overworked so the company could profit without using many employees. I suppose it’s not illegal, but it’s unfair.” The head of the Business Council of Australia condemned the use of JobKeeper to pay bonuses. But the Morrison government hasn’t said a peep.
 
 Australian egalitarianism faces many threats. Multinationals sheltering profits in tax havens. Big firms taking advantage of the recession to buy up their rivals, further concentrating markets. A power imbalance in the workplace that divides employees, reducing the labour share and increasing the profit share. A political philosophy that talks about “leaners” and “lifters”, and ignores the role that luck plays in all our lives.
 
 Recessions worsen inequality. If Australia is to build back better, we need to put equity at the heart of the reconstruction.
 
 Government has a chance to reverse the rise in inequality, and ensure Australia is again a society that prizes “we” over “me”. ANDREW LEIGH IS THE FEDERAL OPPOSITION ASSISTANT TREASURY SPOKESMAN",424
194,Flattening curve while not obliterating our economy,News,2020-09-10T21:47:06.906Z,"We need to keep people in work and small businesses viable
 
 The national strategy to deal with the evolving coronavirus pandemic has been “flattening the curve” of infection. That’s why the government closed our borders, is limiting public gatherings and imposing social isolation, and is urging people to wash their hands. By spreading out the period of contagion, reducing the number of ill people at any one time, we reduce the pressure on health systems, especially on intensive care units. Of course, there’s a trade-off: social distancing measures are hitting the economy like a sledgehammer.
 
 By flattening the curve, economics editor Adam Creighton explained on Tuesday, the economic pain is drawn out. “Businesses that could survive two months of shutdown might not be able to survive four,” he wrote. Scott Morrison now says the government’s $17.6bn stimulus is only a start. The package is trying to keep businesses afloat through payments and wage subsidies, providing tax breaks for investment, and putting cash into the hands of those most likely to spend. Accelerated depreciation rates and instant asset write-offs, we argued last week, appear like the ad hoc things you do to prod companies into expansion when the economy is going sideways.
 
 We are facing a deep recession, with some experts fearing an economic depression, which is a 10 per cent contraction in gross domestic product. Financial markets are responding to what’s happening in society and the real economy, purging their riskiest assets, repricing even safe bets. The Reserve Bank is about to fire its final shot on interest rates, then it’s off to the debt shop and printery. There isn’t much our central bank can do on the demand side; its main game now is supervision, financial stability and liquidity, which all build confidence.
 
 The Prime Minister and his brains trust are working on stimulus 2.0. The initial package, yet to be legislated, is not quite dead on arrival. But it’s becoming clear one of its vaunted design virtues — scalability — will immediately be tested. So, too, will existing delivery systems. How will they perform when IT platforms are inundated and public servants, meant to oversee the handouts ATM, are crook or looking after kids stuck at home? The public sector is playing its role. Those hardy automatic stabilisers — higher welfare payments, lower tax collections — will kick in. The fiscal footprint is about to spread. The states are stepping in with rescue packages. NSW is providing payroll tax and licence fee relief, and increasing construction spending. Queensland will defer taxes on business and provide interest-free loans.
 
 The greatest challenge will be to keep people in jobs. Qantas, for instance, is cutting international flights by 90 per cent. It’s a big company, yet will struggle to hold its workers without assistance. But entire sectors have no buffer when customers disappear; wages, rent and loans are due. Casuals and gig-economy workers will feel the pinch. Banks are providing leeway on credit and energy companies will keep the power on; as we know, they are not charitable institutions. It’s clear the cashflow assistance from Canberra’s first fiscal hit will require more booster shots. One novel measure that could help sole traders and small businesses is a loan facility based on the Higher Education Contribution Scheme.
 
 Finance Minister Mathias Cormann warns that businesses will close and people will lose jobs. During the early 1990s recession — which was policy-induced — it took 12 months for the jobless rate to jump from 6.6 per cent to 9.5 per cent. The unemployment rate peaked at 11.1 per cent a year later and it wasn’t until late 1999 that it recovered to 6.5 per cent. The welfare safety net exists for such calamities. It might need to be modified, temporarily, until this epidemiological and economic bolt from the blue has run its course.Keeping small businesses viable must be a top-order issue. So, too, is making sure skills don’t wither and workers are ready for the eventual recovery. What at first required a targeted, sector-by-sector, fiscal rescue effort is morphing into an emergency maxi-budget. The highest economic priority for government should be to help businesses keep people employed — while continuing to lean forcefully on the COVID-19 infection rate until the medical pressures subside.",739
195,Foundation for recovery comes at a bearable cost,Fairfax,2021-07-12T03:52:23.360Z,"The Herald's View
 
 Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has laid out a plausible plan which, barring new shocks, should be enough to take the Australian economy through a deep COVID-19 recession while keeping the rise in unemployment to a bearable level.
 
 While there is little economic reform, the budget includes a major new round of stimulus worth $98 billion, mostly in the form of income tax cuts for low and middle income earners, business tax cuts and an innovative scheme to pay employers who hire young workers.
 
 This will bridge the fiscal cliff that would have opened up in the next few months as the emergency JobKeeper and JobSeeker programs expire.
 
 The government forecasts unemployment will only rise to 8 per cent, about 4.5 per cent less than if the government had not intervened. Unemployment will remain uncomfortably high at 6.5 per cent in June 2022, when the next election is due, but Australia's performance is expected to be better than most comparable countries.
 
 To pay for the stimulus at a time when revenue has collapsed, the federal government will have to borrow about $470 billion over the next four years. By 2024, net debt will rise to 44 per cent of gross domestic product from 19 per cent last year, a much larger increase than under the ALP during the global financial crisis.
 
 Mr Frydenberg has admitted this is a ""heavy burden"" but he is right to say it is ""a necessary one to responsibly deal with the greatest challenge of our time"".
 
 Debt will still be manageable and fairly low by international standards but it remains a serious concern. Once the economy recovers, the next federal government will have to stabilise and then reduce it.
 
 The task of reducing the deficit will be made easier because many of the stimulus measures announced yesterday are temporary and will expire in the next few years.
 
 The budget tax cuts, which are the largest single expenditure, have been carefully crafted for wage and salary earners on between $37,000 and $120,000 a year. The federal government wisely decided not to bring forward its politically divisive stage three tax cuts, which were skewed to higher income earners. Mr Frydenberg is betting that punters will spend the windfall and restart the economy but he could have had a more direct impact with a much bigger increase in spending on infrastructure, training and the like. He has also left unanswered the question of whether to make permanent the increase in the dole under JobSeeker.
 
 Mr Frydenberg is mostly relying on businesses and consumers to spend and invest their way out of a recession. One more targeted measure is the JobMaker hiring credit, worth $4 billion, which encourages employers to give jobs to Australians under 35. Treasury predicts that in the next three years it will subsidise wages for 450,000 young Australians who would otherwise have been stuck on the dole. Mr Frydenberg is right to focus on the young, who are most likely to suffer persistent unemployment.
 
 Australia will emerge from this recession with a very different economic trajectory. The closure of borders to new migrants is expected to reduce population growth by more than 500,000 people. We will be burdened by much higher national debt and much will depend on the progress made in managing future outbreaks of COVID-19. The budget assumes, for instance, that a vaccine will be widely available by the end of next year.
 
 For now, despite all that uncertainty, the government has outlined a plan that reduces the pain, though at some cost, and lays the foundation for a recovery.

 Class action lawyers have been circling pandemic-struck Australia, staring down with gimlet eyes in search of grievances to inflame. In quieter times they spend their days scanning the transcripts of royal commissions or watching the ABC’s Four Corners.
 
 In 2017, Four Corners reported allegations that firefighting foam containing poly-fluoroalkyl substances had spread toxic pollution to land close to defence force bases. Scary as it sounds, it turns out that most of us have some PFAS in our system and there is no firm evidence they cause disease.
 
 Yet nearby residents and landowners had reason to be alarmed. Four Corners was not the first media outlet to spread fears that PFAS in large quantities might cause cancer, heart disease and put pregnant women and breastfed babies at risk.
 
 The Department of Defence also had reason to be concerned. In the litigious times in which we live, everything is presumed risky until it’s proven safe.
 
 The first three class actions were settled out of court in March. The department agreed to pay $212.5m to class action members near the Williamtown, Katherine and Oakey bases. It amounted to $100,000 per person.
 
 There was also the matter of costs. The services of Shine Lawyers and Dentons, who ran the class actions, do not come cheaply. There were also the fees owed to Omni-Bridgeway, Australia’s biggest ­litigation funder, which was demanding a commission of 30 per cent.
 
 When costs were agreed in court earlier this month, Omni-Bridgeway’s cut was $76.9m, of which $47.7m was profit.
 
 With returns like these, it is little wonder that foreign investment is streaming into Australia, anxious for a slice of the returns.
 
 The purpose of civil law is to deal with citizens whose rights have been infringed. Any remittances that lawyers and funders may make along the way should be incidental.
 
 In the field of class actions, however, the lure of fat profits is driving a spiralling number of class actions in which compensation for the plaintiffs is little more than a by-product.
 
 Our justice system has hurtled along the American path and then some. A study released this week by the Menzies Research Centre found that return on investment last year for Australia’s three biggest litigation funders was between 139 per cent and 165 per cent — 17 times more than investors in ASX 200 stocks and more than 10 times the average global hedge fund.
 
 Not surprisingly, the number of class actions and the size of the claims has risen sharply. In November 2009, it was estimated that there were $2.6bn worth of active class action claims against Australian businesses. By 2019, that figure had quadrupled to more than $10bn.
 
 Meanwhile. the lawyers and funders are helping themselves to ever larger pieces of the cake. In 2016, class action members would receive $6 in every $10 awarded, on average. By last year it had fallen to just $4, with legal and funding fees absorbing the rest.
 
 It is little wonder that litigation funders and law firms are tripping over one another to get a slice of this. No fewer than five teams were bidding to take on AMP after the adverse findings by the financial services royal commission. Maurice Blackburn eventually won the right to seek damages for alleged breaches of corporate regulation. That is not a little ironic, since ­litigation funders are exempt from investment regulations thanks to a decision by Chris Bowen as treasurer in 2013.
 
 Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has now announced that loophole will be closed, putting litigation funders under the supervision of ASIC. It remains to be seen if ASIC is up to the job.
 
 The 1992 introduction of provisions allowing plaintiffs to litigate collectively was well intentioned. It was designed to make justice more affordable by sharing risk and costs. That noble aim has been corrupted by the profit motive.
 
 Lawyers’ duties, long established, are to their clients and to the courts. A litigation funder, however, is under no such obligation. As third parties to legal proceedings, their interest is purely commercial. Yet their power to turn off the funding tap allows them to exercise near-total control over how proceedings are run. They pay the fees for plaintiff ­lawyers, they decide when and how to settle and they can pull their funding at any time.
 
 The potential for a divergence of interest between the class members and funder is considerable. It is particularly troubling that the interests of class members are controlled by strangers to legal proceedings whose sole interest is their return on investment. It is a situation that is ripe for abuse.
 
 Justice apart, there is a strong economic imperative to prioritise the reform of this area of civil law. The escalating cost of proceedings is significantly adding to the cost of doing business at a time when the economy is entering recession. Much of the burden of these costs is ultimately carried by ordinary Australians through the loss of jobs, wages, reduced retirement savings or as taxpayers.
 
 In the case of PFAS, the picnic has barely just begun. As The Sydney Morning Herald reported with naive glee in March, the three cases settled so far are just the tip of the iceberg. At least 90 sites across the country are said to be contaminated with this stuff and class action lawyers are investigating the possibility of legal action at a further 24 military bases.
 
 There is nothing fair about the system as it stands. Its impact is steeply regressive, rewarding some of the richest professionals in the country at the expense of those who can least afford it. Litigation that delivers private profits for a few at the expense of the many is an injustice that should not be allowed to stand. Nick Cater is executive director of the Menzies Research Centre.

198,Good social housing needs more than millions,Fairfax,2021-10-24T03:53:59.285Z,"The state budget allocation of $5.3billion for social housing will move Victoria from straggler to front runner on the national stage.
 
 Community organisations, tenants' associations and housing policy experts have been lobbying for support of this scale for years. They were joined during COVID-19 by economists and the construction industry to make the case that building social housing is the most effective way to create jobs and to stimulate the economy.
 
 But any big social housing solution must be more than just supply. Thousands of Victorians put up in hotels during the pandemic were told to leave their accommodation this week, and initial reports suggest that alternative housing available is not always suitable.Lessons from investments past - such as the federal Labor's Social Housing Initiative of 2009 - have taught us that it's not just the supply, but the delivery that is crucial to improving the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity in Australia.
 
 We need to get the mix of public housing and community housing right. The vast majority of social housing units constructed under the Social Housing Initiative were procured by state or territory governments but then transferred to non-government community housing providers. From 2009 to 2017, the community housing portfolio doubled while public housing stock declined.
 
 Growth in the community housing sector is a good thing. Community housing is an important component of a robust housing sector, and all growth in affordable housing is to be welcomed. However, investing in public housing should be the priority for tackling the issue of homelessness in Australia and providing good quality public housing in appropriate locations is the most effective way to keep people out of homelessness. Data from the University of Melbourne's Journeys Home study - the only longitudinal study in the world that tracks homeless populations alongside at-risk and vulnerable populations - shows that public housing is by far the strongest preventative against homelessness. The Social Housing Initiative invigorated the community housing sector while further residualising the public housing sector. If our goal is to end homelessness in Victoria, we need to make sure that doesn't happen again.
 
 Next, we need to think carefully about design. The Victorian government's promise to build all new units to seven-star efficiency standardswill ensure social housing comfortable in all seasons and cheap to power.Social housing tenants are ageing - around a third are now over 55, and 14 per cent are over 75. Two in five of these households include a tenant with a disability. Existing social housing stock does not cater well for these tenants, who are often unable to live in available units due to accessibility or health and mobility issues. To ensure new social housing units are appropriate they should be built to universal design standards. That means features that are useable regardless of a person's age or other characteristics. Think single-level housing, wide doorways for wheelchair access, worktops at different heights, and walk-in showersThe lack of investment in social housing by successive governments has meant eligibility for the limited stock has tightened to include only those households most at risk.From 2009, the then federal Labor government in partnership with state and territory governments funded a number of tenancy sustainment programs. These helped households to sustain their tenancies and prevent eviction, were effective in reducing homelessness, and were cost effective to government.
 
 This year, a coalition of social housing providers, community organisations, and tenants' groups called on the government to expand these programs.We are faced with the best opportunity in a long time to have a lasting impact on the crises of homelessness and housing insecurity in Victoria.

199,"Great in a crisis, Australia cannot lose it in recovery",News,2020-10-20T20:01:32.721Z,"Nothing should be off the table in revitalising the economy
 
 As the Morrison government does whatever it takes to keep oxygen flowing to the economy’s failing organs, the door is ajar to every red-blooded rent-seeker and schemer in the land. In three escalating emergency moves, it has promised to pump $214bn into the economy to support businesses and top up family incomes. It’s likely Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg will do more on the fiscal front as companies hibernate over winter; a budget in October seems light years away from this vantage point. In any case, it was good to see the Prime Minister and Treasurer hold firm by denying Virgin Australia, now in voluntary administration, a taxpayer bailout. As Mr Frydenberg said, the 90 per cent foreign-owned carrier’s major shareholders have deep pockets, if not gold vaults. With a number of parties interested, a market-led solution offers the airline the best prospect of survival.
 
 Imagine the conga line for deals if the government had made an exception for Virgin Australia. You can grift your way out of bother for a little while, but it’s not a sustainable model to build prosperity for companies or workers. Nor is Big Canberra, as it saunters into novel areas, such as private hospitals, free childcare, brokering rents and nationalising half the nation’s payroll. We take Mr Morrison at his word when he says hard times require mammoth, targeted and temporary responses. Sure, but it won’t be easy to shift out of crisis handout mode, to snap back to tightly means-tested, mutual obligation welfare. Those receiving $1500 a fortnight via the six-month JobKeeper package won’t easily settle for the $1100 JobSeeker payment (which has been doubled) when that day comes. Given the alliance of business, community and union groups pushing for an increase in unemployment benefits before the coronavirus, and its imminent double-digit unemployment rate, a hefty increase in the welfare bill will be baked into the federal budget.
 
 Myriad forces unleashed by COVID-19 are reshaping our nation, shifting the political calculus, watering down ideology, emboldening policymakers and revamping household budgets. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, who is remaking monetary policy, observed on Tuesday that many old rules would no longer apply when the economy comes off the ventilator, due to structural change. Pervading the recovery, expected by the end of this year, will be the shadow of uncertainty that people feel about the future. “We are all learning to work, shop and travel differently,” Dr Lowe noted. “Some of these changes will probably stay with us, requiring a rethinking of business models.” The best way of dealing with these reverberations is to reinvigorate the country’s growth and productivity agenda, which had been put on hold.
 
 As we observed on Wednesday, the RBA governor has been prodding the political class on reforms to make us “a great place for businesses to expand, invest, innovate and hire people”. He set out a broad framework — on tax, infrastructure, education and training, regulation and industrial relations — that sensible experts and legislators have outlined over the past decade. On any of these, both major parties have not even scratched the surface, either in office or as part of election platforms. The thinking has been done: from Ken Henry’s almost nose-to-tail 2010 tax review (he was prevented by Labor from considering the GST) to the Productivity Commission’s landmark 2017 Shifting the Dial strategy ordered up by Mr Morrison as treasurer. Other notable policy contributions have come from the Business Council of Australia on tax, investment and productivity and NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet on reforming federal financial relations through a grand bargain to run social services on a fixed share of income tax.
 
 Many see a spirit of co-operation between governments in responding to COVID-19 via the national cabinet. But the crisis will pass; all parties will revert to playing their customary roles in cost shifting and blame gaming. So the time to strike on reform is now. If Canberra is too “comatose” or “sclerotic”, as Mr Perrottet has described the dynamic, then the states should get on with their own changes. Who’s to stop them? Daniel Andrews has banked a wad of political capital. Will the Victorian Premier use it to build his population’s productive capacity, or fritter it away on niche social progressivism? The NSW Treasurer should abolish stamp duties on property transfers and introduce a superior land tax that makes it easier for people to move to where jobs are located or occupy housing best suited to their stage of life.The crisis is a golden opportunity for state treasurers and finance ministers — not for triage-era announceables, spending boondoggles or a lazy policy holiday. But the opposite: to remove impediments to more investment and employment. Of course, some states are carrying huge debts and an aversion to privatisation that limit their options, especially Queensland. Mr Frydenberg, too, must make the running on red tape and tax reform. Ad hoc investment allowances might make a difference at the margin. But cutting the company tax rate to 25 per cent for all businesses would supercharge capital spending and make our enterprises more globally competitive in the recovery phase. Mr Morrison wants some fresh ideas from business, yet most of the very good ones have been staring policymakers in the face for years. Team Australia head cheerleader Dr Lowe reminds us that all those factors that have made us such a successful and prosperous country will still be there when the coronavirus crisis has passed. It’s how we use those vast endowments that counts.",961
200,Herald Sun,News,2021-09-01T22:32:09.969Z,"Reopen hope for survival ALMOST 32,000 Victorian businesses have signed on to JobKeeper since September alone — an illustration of just how crippling the COVID shutdowns have become.
 
 Small businesses and family operations are the engine room of the state’s economy, employing hundreds of thousands of workers who have for months in 2020, together with so many sole traders, been forced into limbo. More than 800 Victorian businesses each day have been signing up to the federal JobKeeper wage subsidy program in the past 44 days according to data from the Australian Taxation Office — taking the total to 31,862 businesses since the start of September.
 
 By comparison, in New South Wales, 8400 have signed onto JobKeeper in the same period.
 
 The huge uptake of worker hibernation payments in Victoria is not, of course, simply a statistical measure. Livelihoods, trading survivability, household finances, mortgages and careers are at stake. The pandemic has seen about 900,000 Australian loans deferred, including many from business.
 
 Premier Daniel Andrews this week conceded the state’s target infection rate of five new daily cases averaged over a fortnight is now likely to not be reached by September 18 when the next trigger point for lockdown restrictions were due to be eased.
 
 Come Sunday, the Premier has indicated some relaxation to elements of social restrictions are expected, but the pain the business sector is enduring will continue for some time to come.
 
 Mr Andrews says the road map targets and timing for metropolitan Melbourne will be revisited in line with a “stubborn tail’ of infections and the “story” behind those infections (whether they be to known clusters or mystery cases).
 
 And while decisions must continue to be made on the data and science, it is not just the science from within the government’s own health department and chosen academics which needs to be listened to.
 
 The World Health Organisation, as well as a significant number of epidemiological and virology specialists in Australia, warn against undue reliance on the blunt impact of lockdown restrictions in tackling COVID-19.
 
 Recent months have given the Andrews government plenty of opportunity to ramp up and improve the efficiency of contact tracing.
 
 A more creative and adaptive road map is needed to not only give Melburnians greater social freedoms from next Sunday, but to incrementally relieve the existential threat being faced by tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of workers.
 
 By easing restrictions across a wide range of sectors, allowing hospitality, services and retail business to open up with established COVID-safe rules and patron controls, the twin economic and societal challenges can be addressed.
 
 As reported in today’s Herald Sun, the Council of Small Business Organisations has penned an open letter to Mr Andrews which he will receive today demanding a progressive reopening.
 
 The human toll of COVID, in huge part due to quarantine failures, now threatens to also inflict long-term unemployment and indeed poverty for many Victorians unless change is imposed.
 
 Nationally, more than a million businesses are on JobKeeper life support, with 310,128 in Victoria.
 
 As a state which generates a quarter of Australia’s economic output, unless Victoria begins to open up the damage to the national economy — up to $14bn lost here — will also continue to mount.
 
 There will be risk with opening up businesses, but the damage of not doing so is arguably now even greater.
 
 Champ on and off court MELBOURNE’S Dylan Alcott continues to inspire on the international sporting stage.
 
 Alcott’s victory at the weekend in the French Open illustrates not just his remarkable sporting and competitive talent, but again shines as an example for opportunity and achievement.
 
 Alcott has cemented his reputation as one of the all-time greats of wheelchair tennis and one of Australia’s greatest sportsmen.
 
 Amassing his 11th quad singles grand slam triumph at the French Open continues a remarkable career which includes six men’s singles and three men’s doubles titles at the Australian Open, two French Open singles titles, a Wimbledon singles and doubles title, two US Open singles and doubles victories and single and doubles gold at the Paralympics.
 
 On top of those glittering achievements, Alcott, 29, is a champion off the court.
 
 The Australian ace was recently instrumental in getting the US Open to reverse its decision to exclude the wheelchair tournament at Flushing Meadows in New York, where it cited the need to restrict competition size due to COVID.
 
 Hitting out at the discriminatory decision, Alcott sparked a wave of support from some of the biggest names in tennis. Alcott is an Australian champion of talent, fight and decency.",781
201,Here we go again - sacrificing the heart and soul of our city,Fairfax,2020-01-06T07:39:20.736Z,"Winter's first frost reminds me that each night 105,237 Australians are homeless, about 28,000 in Sydney. At the same time, another multi-billion-dollar Sydney development on public land is nearing approval with not a single subsidised dwelling on offer. Not one.
 
 Central Place Sydney is a $2.5 billion development on the Lee Street side of Central Station reportedly ""poised to gain final stage approval"". Stage one of a development bigger than Barangaroo, these towers by Frasers and Dexus will offer about 150,000 square metres of office space. On. Public. Land.
 
 Towers are fine. If there's any proper place for them, the middle of Australia's oldest and most populous city is it. But the middle, near transport and services, is also the place for our poorest citizens. So we should not bestow these development rights - on any land but especially on public land - without getting something back, especially social housing.
 
 Mandatory inclusionary zoning, or MIZ, requires a percentage (usually between 10 and 30 per cent) of all new residential development to be affordable. It's practised in dozens of cities in the US, Britain and Europe. Why is it so hard for us?
 
 In NSW, public and key-worker housing come under the Land and Housing Corporation. The name says it all. The corporation has no funding except what it makes by selling. This results in the poor being exiled to the city's outskirts, where building costs are lower, trapping the neediest people beyond services, jobs and transport. So they still end up on inner Sydney's streets.
 
 True, some have motel accommodation during the lockdown as part of a crisis response, which included almost 900 rental assistance packages. But that's temporary and it should be seen against a subsidised housing waiting list of 50,000 households and a waiting time of up to 10 years.
 
 They're also co-owners of public land, such as Central Station. Scruffy as it is, this precinct is still in many ways Sydney's heart. Pivoting George Street into the rest of Big Australia, it's a hub of deep history, diversity and energy. It belongs to and should benefit us all - including those in cardboard boxes.
 
 Some years ago, conscious of imminent change around Central, I set up a series of meetings with Sydney-shapers. They included the lord mayor, a couple of Lend Lease honchos, the head of Arup and some boofy dudes from Infrastructure NSW. To each I put a proposition. Sooner or later, I reasoned, the 23 hectares of public land behind Central Station would be developed. Why not form an advance group of thought leaders, visionaries even, to imagineer its future? We'd produce drawings and design propositions that deployed part of the enormous profit from this public land to create a modicum of public delight.
 
 How? There are three main ways. One, design the streets before the buildings as good places to be. (Frasers did this well under Stanley Quek's leadership at Central Park). Two, impose an overall mistress-plan - the inverse of a masterplan - restoring the remnant of Prince Alfred Park to the size it should always have been, and arrange the buildings around that centrepiece. Three, apply mandatory inclusionary zoning. Include the poor.
 
 Thus (I tried to persuade them) we'd avoid yet another soulless and windswept nightmare of brittle shops and glassy towers. Central would retain its place as Sydney's heart. Wouldn't that be great? Win-win. Each Great Person nodded sagely then, with varying degrees of politeness, told me to get lost.
 
 The result is what we now see emerging, shops and towers with little sign of public amenity, much less public housing. Why is this OK?
 
 Development rights are a public asset. Bestowing them so cheaply is profligate. We should receive royalties, benefits. At Central, two quite separate categories of public asset are being exploited, land and development rights. They'll deliver huge private profit, yet public benefit is minimal. I know. This is Sydney. Wasting public assets is what we've always done.
 
 The recent development boom has plonked Crown casino, Lend Lease's Barangaroo and its four-tower Darling Square all on public land. Not a single social dwelling among them. Mirvac's Harold Park yielded 76 affordable units. Good, but still a tiny percentage.
 
 Lend Lease's latest tranche of Barangaroo towers, One Sydney Harbour, boasts of selling one-bedroom flats off the plan for more than $3 million and two-bedders for more than $6.5 million. With children and families sleeping in the street, that's obscene.
 
 What's extraordinary is that housing homeless people is cheaper. A government assessment of Brisbane's Common Ground initiative found in 2015 that housing poor people cost $13,100 less per person per year than the jails and health services demanded by homelessness.
 
 Such provisions should be the new normal. Central Place may be an office development, but there's no reason a sweet little village couldn't be included. It would benefit everyone: those housed, the rich (who can get cleaners and teachers) and the public purse. Mandatory inclusionary zoning could save Sydney's soul.
 
 Wasting public assets is what we've always done.",893
202,Hidden figures mask jobs horror,Fairfax,2021-11-21T12:09:14.661Z,"We've received the most appalling statistics since the Great Depression, a fact only revealed in the fine print.
 
 Voters have highly stereotyped views about which side of politics is better at handling which of our problems. So it's no surprise the party of the bosses is seen as better at managing the economy, the budget and interest rates, whereas the party of the workers is regarded as better at industrial relations and anything that involves the government spending money.
 
 These stereotypes aren't necessarily right, but they're deeply engrained in our thinking. What keeps politics interesting, however, is that voters' list of our most pressing problems keeps changing with our circumstances. Sometimes Liberal strongpoints are at the top; sometimes Labor strongpoints. The new problem for Scott Morrison is that though the Libs are seen as best at managing the economy and the budget, when the economy falls into recession, voters' focus shifts to the massive unemployment.
 
 That's a problem his opponents are regarded as better at - perhaps because we know fixing it involves spending shed-loads of money. The Libs are feeling terribly guilty about the $200 billion they've committed to spending so far, and are telling themselves they'll be turning off the tap in September, come what may.
 
 I'm sure you remember the shocking TV footage we saw some weeks back of long queues outside Centrelink offices. You've seen the movie; now read the stats. They arrived last Thursday. They showed what had happened in the jobs market just between mid-March and mid-April. They were the most appalling news on jobs we've had since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Actually, they're worse than then, in the sense that they happened in just a month (with some more bad months to come), whereas in the Depression it all took several years.
 
 But the unique nature of this coronacession - where, acting under doctors' orders, the government simply instructed non-essential businesses to close their doors - makes it much harder than usual to see what's happening in what the media call ""the jobs market"" and the Australian Bureau of Statistics calls ""the labour force"".
 
 At present, a lot of the job loss remains hidden. Tracing what's happening is like peeling an onion. Except that onions get smaller as you peel, whereas this problem gets bigger as you delve into the fine print. Much bigger.
 
 How do we know how bad it was in the Depression? We know the rate of unemployment got to 20 per cent. By that measure, our problem is small. In April the number of people classed as unemployed by the bureau rose by about 100,000 to more than 800,000. Expressed as a proportion of the labour force (that is, everyone with a job or actively seeking one), the rate of unemployment rose just from 5.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent.
 
 But don't trust this. As most people know, the bureau's definition of what it means to be unemployed is very narrow. You have to be actually looking for work and ready to take up any job you're offered. You get a better idea from the news that, of the 13 million Australians employed in March, 900,000 lost their jobs in April. However - and I know you'll find this hard to believe - 300,000 people without jobs gained one during the month, so the net loss of jobs was almost 600,000.
 
 But why, then, did unemployment rise by only 100,000 rather than 600,000? Because 500,000 people didn't look for another job - understandable since so many employers were in lockdown - and so were classed as ""not in the labour force"".
 
 So that's the first source of hidden joblessness. Most of those people will start looking for jobs as soon as it makes sense to, and then will be counted as unemployed.
 
 The next source of hiddenness comes from the new and worthy JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme, intended to preserve the attachment between employers and their workers even though, during the lockdown, those employers don't have much work needing to be done.
 
 There are now more than 6 million workers on the JobKeeper allowance - that is, about half the entire workforce. Because they're receiving a wage, they're all counted as employed. Some are working pretty much as normal and some are working reduced hours, but many do no work at all.
 
 It turns out that the best guide to what's happening comes from the change in the total number of hours worked during the month. It's fallen by an unprecedented 9.2 per cent, double the 4.6 per cent fall in the number of people employed.
 
 The fall in hours is explained by people losing their jobs, people keeping their jobs but being given fewer hours to work, and people on JobKeeper working fewer hours - or none. This explains why, despite the limited rise in unemployment, the rate of underemployed workers (those working fewer hours than they want to) leapt from 8.8 per cent to 13.7 per cent.
 
 All told, that means about 2.7 million people - almost one worker in five - either lost their job or lost hours during just a month. Gosh.

203,HOW MUCH OF OUR VILLAGE DO WE BURN TO CONTAIN THIS?,News,2020-12-20T04:14:40.294Z,"We are trying to protect the economy we are dismantling with health restrictions Australia is trapped in the ultimate vicious circle of the COVID-19 threat — governments are impos­ing a massive recession on the economy and liquidating jobs on a huge scale, with inevitable conflicts among political leaders about the depth of the pain they impose.
 
 The core calculation is that the community is better off with mass job losses than seeing the hospital system in intolerable crisis. Put brutally, the calculation is that people are better off unemployed than sick or dead.
 
 The reality, however, is these are different groups: it is the young and middle-aged who are losing their jobs, while those most likely to get sick are the retired elderly, often with existing health issues. The Morrison government’s fiscal measures so far are geared to small-business jobs and equity, with many vulnerable people getting­ job and income assistance.
 
 That is essential. Australia is a far richer nation than in the 1930s, with the better-off able to cope for a long time by accessing their saving­s and wealth, a reality highlighting the need for the financially powerful — banks, landlords, cashed-up big companies — to meet their wider social responsib­ilities. The debate over equity and “who carries the burden” will be critical and dangerous.
 
 Yet the events of the past several­ days expose the dilemma: this is not a crisis where the un­precedented action from the government and the Reserve Bank can restore confidence, as occurs in a purely economic or financial crisis. The total fiscal and monetary response from the authorities is greater than 10 per cent of GDP and will continue to grow. We have seen nothing like this intervention in our lifetimes. In an ortho­dox downturn it would have a dramatically beneficial impact.
 
 Yet it is not enough. It cannot suffice. Nor will a third fiscal package suffice, despite its necessity. The packages are definitely worthwhile but economic instruments cannot beat a pandemic.
 
 This is not to belittle the impressive bipartisan parliamentary session­ on Monday that passed an expanded $84bn stimulus support package — a tribute to both the Coalition and Labor — while the US congress was still squabbling over the scope of its package. Here is genuine good news: our parliament stood up. It offered an ­example to the nation, rare given its dismal efforts in recent years.
 
 The agonising contradiction in our public policy can hardly be comprehended: the government is pumping money to sustain jobs and activity while its health measures throw demand off the cliff and keep consumers in home detention. The economic arm fights the health arm, a contradiction unavoidable yet deeply destructive.
 
 The Morrison government and RBA interventions are essential yet markets will not stabilise, rising unemployment cannot be checked and falling demand cannot be reversed until progress is seen on the health front. This is the roadblock to the future. As Scott Morrison told parliament, the nation faces its gravest test since World War II.
 
 Yet evidence of progress against the virus is limited. Infections nationwide exceed 2000, doubling every three or four days. There is growing evidence the health response — on which everything depends — has been inadequate. The next three weeks should offer a clearer judgment.
 
 Defending the progress, Health Minister Greg Hunt said the nation­ has prevented “the onset of the spread”. The delay has bought time for the hospital and medical system to better prepare. The seven deaths in the first 1000 cases are fewer than in most other countries (the toll is now eight). Hunt said that with 147,000 tests our testing levels were high, and positive results, at only 1.2 per cent, compared with 13 per cent for the US and 5 per cent for Britain.
 
 The fear, however, is that Australia’s response has been too late, too geared to mitigation not suppression, too focused on a strategy for the hospital system rather than a strategy to shock the public and force behavioural change. The government plan has been to slow the virus but keep the economy running. This policy spans a six-month timeline, yet it is fraying. What happened last Sunday was an outbreak of panic and urgency from Victoria and NSW with premiers Dan Andrews and Gladys Berejiklian lurching towards more radical economic shutdowns, despera­te to check the spiral of infections in their states. Morrison wound back some of their push that evening.
 
 Two events symbolise the failure — the Bondi Beach fiasco and the Ruby Princess blunder when passengers, some sick, were allowe­d to disembark in Sydney, the upshot on Tuesday being 133 cases from the boat. The conclusion is that governments have not been sufficiently ruthless because the health advice was not suffic­iently forward leaning.
 
 The national cabinet agreed on Sunday night on a stage-one nation­wide shutdown from Monda­y covering a range of non-essential services — clubs, pubs, restaur­ants, cafes, gyms. Non-essential­ travel should not occur. The AFL and NRL seasons are suspended. These collective decis­ions threw thousands out of work. This is not just a job crisis, it is a life crisis. Many people are losing the social reference points that sustained them. How much of our village­ do we burn to escape the virus?
 
 The speed of the virus exceeds the speed of human decision-­making. Governments are like a retreating army, surrendering one fallback position after another. With each fallback, the economy shrinks further. The final retreat is social and economic lockdown. Talking with ministers on Monday they agreed the core economy — factories, construction, manufacturing, mining — must stay operational, there must be limits on how much of the economy is closed. Tougher action seemed certain to emerge from the national cabinet on Tuesday night. Stage two of the shutdown might be rolled out. Does it make sense to lock down the entire Australian economy? No, not yet. Morrison warns that decisions will have long-run consequences. One thing is obvious: the economy cannot be locked down for six months. The real issue the national cabinet should address is where to draw the line as measures are tightened.
 
 Having blundered in his early response, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has gone towards lockdown: Britons will only be allowe­d to leave their home for essential­ shopping, daily exercise, medical needs and limited work travel. This is an admission of earlier containment failure.
 
 One task Australia needs to improve is dramatising the message. Forget the nonsense about putting a non-politician in charge to speak the truth. There is no such person and no such truth. Opposition health spokesman Chris Bowen said: “It is impossible to overreact to this crisis.” A better line, perhaps, is that “it is impossible to exaggerate the warnings”. And the warnings have not been strong enough.
 
 On the economic side, the government knows another package is necessary, and probably soon. It needs to address larger business, that is, businesses with a turnover above $50m. These companies carry individual clout. If some fell over, the consequences would be dire. The government needs to think of measures that offer permanent tax relief and investment incentives for the companies that make a difference, and extend its concept of the bridge to a corporate tax policy that endures.
 
 The final aspect of the vicious circle is that the longer the economy is put in the freezer, the more permanent damage will be done. There will be a recovery but it will take years. The US didn’t properly recover from the Great Depression until World War II. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warns unemployment there could hit 20 per cent. Josh Frydenberg said our Treasury has costed about a million Australians getting the new coronavirus supplement payment. Australia faces the grim prospect of a peak in unemployment over the past half century.Don’t think politics has been suspended. On Monday Labor did two things — voted for the package but outlined a critique of the government, saying its measures were too slow, with too many gaps and needed to be implemented faster with guarantees for workers. This policy split will be pivotal at the next election.",1385
204,I tried ice aged 63 and got addicted,Fairfax,2020-10-25T11:55:17.002Z,"The government needs to think less about its 'tough on drugs' image and start helping people.
 
 I have been the chief executive of several companies and before that was a general manager of the NSW Legal Aid Commission. I am blessed with good health, a loving wife, successful children and staggeringly beautiful grandchildren. And for a short time, from the age of 63, I was an ice addict.
 
 When acquaintances asked me if I wanted to try a pipe of ""Tina"", I didn't know what they were talking about. I had never tried drugs, was a social drinker and non-smoker. They were high performing, successful people who were smoking methamphetamine to stay awake and work harder, longer hours. I was exhausted and stressed, and before long, I joined them.
 
 Addiction came hard and fast. Within four months my personality had completely changed. Swinging from paranoia to hallucinations, I had a city apartment where I lived during the week, which enabled me to hide what I was doing from my family. On weekends I would head home out of Sydney to continue my usual routine of family dinners and household chores, covering up my addiction as best I could.
 
 It was a paranoid episode that finally tipped them off. The day of my deepest shame, and greatest pride, was when my children came to my rescue. They virtually kidnapped me from the apartment and put me into treatment. Regardless of my mistakes, they loved me. My wife and I had raised them to be strong and compassionate.
 
 That wasn't the end of my addiction. I relapsed and ended up in the criminal justice system. As someone who had, among other things, been involved in the work of the Nagle Royal Commission into NSW Prisons, it was certainly a dramatic turn of events.
 
 Having experienced drug addiction and both sides of the justice system, it is clear to me that drug laws must be changed. When a person is in the grasp of addiction, police, courts and prisons are not the most effective means to support them to make changes for the better.
 
 The recommendations from the Special Commission of Inquiry into the Drug Ice are an excellent blueprint for badly needed reform, backed by evidence. Experience from around the world shows treating personal drug use as a health and social issue saves lives and doesn't increase use. The best example is Portugal, with almost 20 years of positive results. Many US states are moving to decriminalisation or even legalisation.
 
 In Australia, every state except NSW and Queensland has made similar moves to the three-strikes system before Premier Gladys Berejiklian's cabinet. However, in NSW, ""law and order"" retail politics is again being raised in an attempt to block this positive initiative from being adopted. This continued politicisation of what should be evidence-based policy has prompted me to speak out.
 
 As someone who understands firsthand, I say to NSW MPs: diverting people who experience drug dependency into treatment is no ""soft"" option. You can't be ""hard"" or ""soft"" on drugs. As the experts recommend, people experiencing drug dependency require evidence-based treatment options to avoid the many health and social impacts that addiction leads to.
 
 ""Tough"" laws are not reducing drug use. If you want to reduce drug use, you need to give people access to treatment and guide them in that direction instead of into the criminal justice system.
 
 And those who do have a problem with drugs or alcohol are not ""dopes"".
 
 Drug use is common. Over 43 per cent of Australians over 14 have tried an illegal drug in their lifetime. And for the small proportion of drug users who become dependent - drugs don't discriminate. Young or old, disadvantaged or privileged, educated or not. It could be you, or your children or your parents. If that happened, wouldn't you choose treatment over prison?
 
 I am incredibly lucky to have crashed fast, had strong family support, found treatment and managed to come out of addiction with my family and everything pretty much intact.
 
 My experience shows there is no stereotype when it comes to who uses ice or any other drug. It shows that, with the right compassion and support, people can get their lives back on track.
 
 Ms Berejiklian and her cabinet should know that when it comes to methamphetamines, the ""soft"" option is to keep the status quo. While it may seem the ""hard option"" to attempt to change this critically flawed system, it is clearly the only right option.

205,"In grim times, we need all our wits, not word games",News,2021-10-19T21:06:13.686Z,"Only truth and reason can put us on the path to solutions We live in deadly serious times — of pandemic, a plunge into recession and a dangerous reversal in our national security — yet some educated elites show no grasp of this new reality. Worse, they abuse freedoms and trash democratic values as these legacies of the West are under threat from authoritarian regimes. The parallel rightly has been drawn with the 1930s, a prelude to disaster on a vast scale, and we have the added terror of a miscalculation going nuclear.
 
 On Wednesday Scott Morrison gave a sobering account of our predicament. As Paul Kelly writes on Saturday in Inquirer: “Morrison has warned the Australian people the deepest recession for decades now runs in parallel with a heightening risk of military conflict as the sinews of regional prosperity face ‘almost irreversible strain’, demanding a revamped defence posture and strategy.” As a nation we will need to muster a high seriousness, a spirit of sacrifice and gritty determination to weather the challenges ahead.
 
 Yet we too are swept up in Anglosphere activist hysteria, driven by social media, which turns inward to denounce the historical flaws of the West, oblivious to external threats and manipulation by China and Russia right now and in the future. Imperfect but elected governments in Australia, the US and Europe need the support of an informed and responsible citizenry. Yet these open societies are subject to destructive political attack from within, and the mobs toppling statues and screaming slogans are bereft of ideas for workable reform.
 
 Consider the “progressive” response to Australia’s reluctant but unavoidable decision to invest more heavily in military defence. Some commentators dismiss it as militarism and proof there is no need for financial austerity elsewhere. Sombre ABC figures interview one another about the threat to democracy of an $84m indexation freeze in a $1bn-plus budget. Vested interests lobby the government for handouts, as if the explosion in public debt has blown away any limits to spending. What these Australians refuse to see is obvious to regional powers such as Indonesia that acknowledge the imperative for our more robust defence posture.
 
 China’s police-state takeover of Hong Kong has been compared to Adolf Hitler’s ominous absorption of Austria within the Reich. This strikes at freedom and prosperity in our part of the world, yet it was the remote and misleading Black Lives Matter movement that made thousands of Australians take to the streets in defiance of pandemic restrictions they had championed when others fretted in lockdown. The death of George Floyd was horrific, but viewing it chiefly through a racial lens was questionable, whereas the facts about Chinese government human rights abuses against ethnic and religious minorities are clear. Our anti-racists are overzealous in only some contexts. When the Prime Minister shut down travel from China on public health grounds, there were commentators who framed this as Sinophobic and the kind of thing to be expected of a government imposing “racist” offshore detention on asylum-seekers.
 
 The BLM protests, like cancel culture, suffer from a preoccupation with symbolic struggles and language policing. The New York Times brought urgent news that the Associated Press had decided to capitalise the letter B in black. This conveyed “an essential and shared sense of history”, an AP functionary intoned. The decision followed “more than two years of debate and research”. Imagine if that time and thought had been directed to lifting the quality of school education, which would disproportionately benefit blacks. But why bother with messy realities when you can curate vocabulary?
 
 In Australia, yet again, Closing the Gap targets fail to be met, reflecting real human misery, but activists put their energy into importing the word slavery from America’s historical lexicon. At The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, a clutch of young arts writers cancel themselves as if their “whiteness” must permeate and corrupt their cultural coverage. Nobody wants skin colour to be an obstacle to advancement, but must we reduce individuals to tribal ciphers? Better a writer of unknown race who is faithful to the craft of representing the world than a designated “person of colour” who filters all subject matter through the lens of race. It’s striking that surveys show US black voters on the left are less preoccupied with anti-racism than their white leftist counterparts.
 
 In Inquirer, Noel Pearson makes the point that the “social breakdown consequent upon economic exclusion and unemployment is never a racial­ problem, it is a human problem­”. The dignity of work, a family that functions, safe and thriving communities — these are what people need. Creating culture is hard, cancelling it easy. This doesn’t mean past wrongs should go uncondemned, but it’s better to build monuments to indigenous achievement in real time. Fixing problems and enabling worthwhile lives will require drawing on science, technology and reason, tools that belong to everyone. The same goes for climate change, as US environmentalist Michael Shellenberger argued powerfully in this newspaper on Thursday. An emotive glossing over of uncertainties that are awkward for an activist narrative only weakens trust in science. Zeal gives green causes traction, but factual honesty and pragmatic policy have to prevail if we are to have any hope of marshalling limited resources for the right outcome. It’s a mistake to be too pessimistic about the frenzy of activism by progressive elites. Pushback has begun. People unwilling to echo empty slogans about complex issues are being bullied into silence and dishonesty. There is resentment and quiet fury among the sensible mainstream, as well as lively debate about how to reconnect with the intelligence and goodwill of the human species for the real work of reform, not woke word games.",972
207,"Investing in public housing, and lives",Fairfax,2020-10-25T18:45:18.228Z,"Governments looking to stimulate the economy aim to create jobs, boost consumer confidence, support industries, or deliver support to our most vulnerable. Sometimes, investments and initiatives do all of the above.
 
 The Andrews government's announcement that it will invest $5.3 billion to construct more than 12,000 new homes statewide - including 8200 new social housing homes and replacing 1100 old public housing units - is a historic announcement that will not only create jobs and stimulate the economy, but one that will change thousands of lives.
 
 The reality is that for some in our community, the ebb and flow of the private rental market is simply too brutal. Social housing provides security of tenure and rent set at a level that allows people to rebuild their lives. It provides a safety net, and offers people dignity, stability and opportunities they need to take part in their community.
 
 At Berry Street, we know that, sadly, half of the young people who leave care when they turn 18 experience homelessness.
 
 And we know that one of the barriers to victims escaping family violence is the lack of a safe place to go, and a fear of homelessness.
 
 Indeed, Victoria was already facing a housing and homelessness crisis before COVID-19, which has only worsened as a result of the pandemic. Department of Health and Human Service figures show that on any given day in Victoria about 25,000 people are sleeping rough or living in emergency or unsafe accommodation.
 
 For decades, our public housing system has been neglected, resulting in thousands of the most disadvantaged in our community going without a roof over their head.
 
 In making this $5.3 billion investment, the Premier, Treasurer, and Minister for Housing Richard Wynne, have again made public housing a key part of social policy.
 
 It is a significant step that will help address Victoria's social housing, while also supporting about 10,000 jobs, to bolster the state's economic recovery. It also provides the much-needed one-off boost in housing availability and a pipeline of investment for the next decade.
 
 This is the biggest single spend on social housing in Victoria's history, and demonstrates the social justice credentials of the Andrews Labor government.
 
 What's needed now is for the federal government to match the Victorian government's investment to truly address our homelessness and social housing needs.
 
 Budgets are about priorities.",412
208,IS SOCIAL HOUSING WORTH THE COST?,News,2021-12-09T05:27:09.829Z,"It is unclear whether long-term occupancy really provides a service to residents
 
 Public housing is in the news with the lockdown of several Melbourne towers amid the spread of COVID-19. There were regular live crosses on news bulletins. Stranded residents were unhappy about the lack of notice and inadequate catering to their needs.
 
 Melburnians are used to the imposing ugliness of these inner-suburban buildings. Built in the 1960s and 70s from precast concrete, they provide accommodation for many, often dis­ad­vantaged, residents.
 
 Whether it was a good idea to build them and if it might be sensible to demolish them are constantly debated. Other than their handy locations, there is little to commend them. They offer inadequate accommodation with shared laundry facilities and often broken-down lifts.
 
 Several are drug-dealing hubs and violence is common. Some residents have uneasy relations with the police.
 
 Their origin owes much to overseas developments. In Britain, run-down housing in parts of London and other cities was torn down and high-rise flats, often 20 or 30 storeys, constructed instead. Quite quickly, the slums that were demolished were replaced by another type of slum.
 
 In Melbourne, there was a similar flattening of shabby inner-city houses. About 4000 houses were demolished, replaced by 7000 flats in tower blocks.
 
 Few residents of the houses were relocated to the flats, and the houses that survived have been restored, renovated and sell for high prices.
 
 Recently, some commentators have pushed for more government spending on public housing — also referred to as social housing — to stimulate the economy while meeting an obvious social need.
 
 The best information on this comes from the Productivity Commission, which publishes the Report on Government Services each year and looks at housing and homelessness.
 
 The states and territories are largely responsible for the construction, maintenance and administration of public housing; the federal government provides support through rental assistance. The National Housing and Homelessness Agreement between the federal government and the states and territories is the principal means of directing federal funds to support public housing and the homeless.
 
 Substantial sums are involved. In 2019-20, more than $3bn of federal money was provided for housing and a further $4.6bn was provided for Commonwealth Rent Assistance. State and territory expenditure is also considerable.
 
 What role does public housing play in Australia? About two-thirds of households are homeowners or purchasers, 27 per cent are private renters, with slightly more than 3 per cent in public housing. That number has dropped from almost 4 per cent in a decade.
 
 The ACT has the highest proportion, at 6.8 per cent; Victoria the lowest, at 1.7 per cent. South Australia also has a high proportion (4.9 per cent), reflecting the historical legacy of state government policies that used public housing as a form of industrial development dating from the Playford era.
 
 The type of households in public housing has changed. Where once there were families with dependent children, the typical occupant now is a single person, although many flats are overcrowded. This has led to a disjunction where about one-sixth of public housing is underused in terms of bedrooms with another one-sixth significantly over­crowded.
 
 One of the principal reasons for investing in public housing is to relieve “rental stress” on low-income earners — defined as spending more than 30 per cent of gross household income on rent.
 
 According to the Productivity Commission, in 2017-18, 43 per cent of private renters were on low incomes. About half experienced rental stress. Without rental assistance, close to 70 per cent would have experienced rental stress. Even with the assistance, many still suffer from it.
 
 More public housing residents are likely to be unemployed. But in relative terms, rents have fallen across time, reflecting manner in which rents are set in relation to income.
 
 The research on the effect of public housing tenure on employment outcomes is not clear-cut. But for those on the waiting list — and it is possible to be on a public housing waiting list for years — it seems some are dissuaded from active, full-time employment lest they jeopardise their place in the queue.
 
 Failed experiments to encourage more affordable housing for low-income and disadvantaged households are common. A recent example was the National Rental Affordability Scheme introduced with much fanfare in 2008 by the then newly elected federal Labor government.
 
 The plan was for 50,000 units to be built and to be rented at below market rates to low-income earners, with the federal government paying a subsidy of $6000 annually to the owners of the units for up to 10 years.
 
 It was a shemozzle. The building program was slow — the target of 50,000 was to be met by June 30, 2012, but by mid-2015 only 26,000 dwellings had been constructed.
 
 Because of the way the subsidy was designed, the developers ended up constructing a large number of — cheaper — studio apartments and many of the occupants were low-income earners only by virtue of being university students. International students also qualified.
 
 The scheme was wound up by the incoming Coalition government although the subsidies continue to be paid out under the agreement.
 
 Public housing policy can be devised only in the context of an understanding of the housing market. With the population recently allowed to grow rapidly by dint of high net overseas migration, there were always going to be significant price pressures, particularly given government-imposed restrictions on new housing investment — think zoning and release of land. That most migrants head to Melbourne and Sydney is another complication. Whether long-term occupancy in public housing really provides a service to residents is not entirely clear, particularly where residents are locked into deficient, possibly dangerous accommodation. It is a worthwhile debate before even more taxpayer money is spent on public housing.",994
209,It's taken far too long to rectify robo-debt,Fairfax,2020-08-21T07:23:00.896Z,"Welfare cheats. It's an emotive term often wheeled out by politicians seeking an easy headline. That was certainly the case in 2016 when the then Turnbull government announced its new fully automated system for clamping down on welfare overpayments.
 
 It sounded efficient and foolproof. While an annual 20,000 notifications had been sent out seeking refunds using a manual system involving compliance officers, the computerised version could generate 20,000 a week. Matching income data from the Australian Taxation Office with a welfare recipient's payments, anomalies could be rapidly identified and automatically targeted. Debt notices worth more than $4 million started flying out the door each day.
 
 With such an enormous escalation in those targeted for alleged overpayments during the previous six years, it took little time for the ""robo-debt"" system to attract widespread criticism. When Senate committees and the Commonwealth Ombudsman started looking under the hood, what they found was hardly complimentary.
 
 It was found to be poorly implemented with little consultation; concerns were raised over how the ATO income data was calculated; the mechanism for disputing a debt was extremely difficult to navigate; and the onus of proof had shifted to place the welfare recipient squarely in the position of having to prove their innocence.
 
 Yet it took until November last year, facing two separate challenges from Victoria Legal Aid, for the government to finally concede that the system needed overhauling. An internal email from Government Services Minister Stuart Robert told staff previous debts would be reviewed, but he claimed only a ""small cohort"" of people was affected.
 
 Last week, that facade was finally torn away, with the government agreeing to repay $721 million to 373,000 Australians who had been hit with debt notices based on flawed calculations. But sorting out the mess still has some way to go. Of the hundreds of thousands who are owed money, the government does not have full and current details for almost half. It will make payments to 190,000 from July and try to contact the remainder. It also faces a class action from Gordon Legal, which claims to have more than 11,000 people who have joined the case.
 
 The government has already conceded in the courts that the way it calculated many of the debt notices was unlawful, while Attorney-General Christian Porter has publicly admitted damages may have to be paid to the hundreds of thousands of people hit with debt notices based on those flawed calculations. An apology was not forthcoming, with Mr Porter saying he could not issue one for legal reasons.
 
 The federal government hands over tens of billions of dollars each year in social security and welfare payments. It's an enormously complex system that must cater to a huge number of circumstances. The vast majority of people are honest and upfront in what they receive.
 
 For the integrity of the system, it is a legitimate and necessary task of government to reclaim debts from those who secure too much. But it must be done in a methodical and humane way that allows for a fair adjudication between competing parties when disputes arise. These were not boxes ticked by the robo-debt scheme, and the government should be red-faced for taking so long to fully accept that reality. Especially given that the victims of this were some of the most vulnerable people in our society.",579
210,It's time to stop demonising the social security system,Others,2021-08-10T04:47:51.896Z,"The coronavirus pandemic and the Australian government's response has demonstrated the importance of a strong social security system to alleviate poverty and stabilise the economy. This crisis presents an opportunity for us to address inadequacies in the current system by building on its strengths.
 
 Historically, our social security system, hand in hand with the decent wages and conditions delivered by our system of wage arbitration, has been crucial to making Australia the relatively egalitarian society we are. As a nation, we take pride in our universal healthcare and public education. A decent social safety net should be seen as a third pillar of equality, but it is something that we don't take that same pride in as a nation. This needs to change.
 
 Since March, almost 600,000 Australians have applied for JobSeeker payment, the new name for the unemployment benefit previously known as Newstart allowance. Around 6 million Australians will receive JobKeeper, a $1500 wage subsidy through their employers. This demonstrates the power of social security to keep people out of poverty.
 
 Social security is also a powerful tool to eradicate poverty. This was demonstrated by the Hawke government when they chose to reduce child poverty by 80 per cent and by the Gillard government when they chose to lift one million pensioners out of poverty with the largest increase to the pension in its history. Once again, we can make a choice - to ensure that after the pandemic, a decent guaranteed income remains available to people experiencing unemployment.
 
 Unfortunately, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has made it clear that he will not be making this choice, designating September 24, 2020 as the day the coronavirus supplement will end and JobSeeker payment will return to the disgracefully inadequate rate of less than $40 a day.
 
 Conservatives have long been intent on demonising the social security system and its recipients, but the facts simply don't support their claims the system is out of control or unsustainable. Australia has the most tightly targeted payment system in the OECD - meaning the greatest proportion of money goes to those most in need. The system is complicated, but mostly for good reason. Different types of payments - pensions, allowances, and family payments - serve specific objectives, and together provide a framework that would deliver a strong social safety net. But years of cuts and neglect have meant that payments have become inadequate, with the most glaring example being JobSeeker.
 
 The basic rate - $565.70 per fortnight for a single person over 22 - speaks for itself. I don't need to explain why people can't live on $40 a day. But the rate is only part of the problem. Unlike pensions that are indexed to wages, the unemployment benefit and other allowances are indexed to CPI and therefore have fallen well behind community living standards. Further, if a recipient begins to earn income, the payment is reduced by 50 cents for every dollar over $104 per fortnight, then 60 cents in every dollar over $254. They are trapped in poverty.
 
 By doubling the JobSeeker rate with the temporary coronavirus supplement the Morrison government has acknowledged that people cannot live on $40 a day. The ugly political reality of this is that the government was only willing to make JobSeeker liveable when a broader group of people would come to rely on it; people who otherwise probably would not have because of economic factors outside of their control. That in itself is a profound acknowledgement from this conservative government that people become unemployed because of structural changes in the economy - not because they weren't ""having a go"".
 
 In addition to alleviating poverty, by using the social security system to deliver this assistance the Government has also demonstrated how effective the social security system is to stabilise the economy. Labor did this in the Global Financial Crisis, along with using the tax system, when Ken Henry said ""Go early. Go hard. Go Households"". It worked and hopefully it will again this time. We need to stop demonising the social security system and instead build it up to ensure it can respond to whatever challenges our changing world and struggling economy throws at it.
 
 Many are still left outside of the government's assistance - casuals, temporary visa holders, young students, the arts sector.
 
 There is a broader opportunity here for Australia too - to put the debates and disinformation of the past to rest, to ensure that our unemployment benefit never returns to inadequacy, and that we as a nation take the pride we should in building a social safety net that protects us all.

211,IT’S HOW CHINA WOULD REACT,News,2021-06-25T02:54:59.684Z,"WE now know what it’s like to live in a Chinese dictatorship. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has shown us by fighting the virus just as China did.
 
 He’s locked up 3000 residents in nine Melbourne public housing towers, with police outside the door.
 
 And he’s warned them: get tested or stay longer than five days in your arbitrary home imprisonment.
 
 “If you were to refuse a test, you would stay locked down in your unit or flat.” Indefinite imprisonment, for committing no crime.
 
 Indefinite imprisonment, sanctioned by no court.
 
 Mind you, all Victorians were confined to their homes in Dictator Dan’s first round of virus lockdown. Many other Australians also had to stay home.
 
 That lockdown wasn’t as harsh as this one at the nine towers, but Victorians did let themselves be banned from enjoying even the most risk-free pleasures — fishing, camping and golfing.
 
 It’s only now — with police standing guard at these towers — that activists of the Left feel alarmed.
 
 But many of the 3000 people in these towers are immigrants! Worse, many are Africans! That suddenly makes this imprisonment not just unfair, draconian and dangerous, but even racist.
 
 The Premier’s “hard lockdown will deprive some of Victoria’s most disadvantaged people of their freedom”, protested The Age, warning that “the Flemington commission towers have a difficult history with Victoria Police, with racial profiling used by officers in and around the area”.
 
 The Flemington and Kensington Community Legal Centre now complains that this localised lockup is “frankly discriminatory”, and the Victorian Council of Social Service warned that “if we get this (lockdown) wrong, the consequences will be horrific”.
 
 Is a lockdown only a crime against humanity if the people being locked down include many Africans?
 
 As it happens, there are actually more reasons for this lockdown than there were for the wider one imposed earlier on millions of Australians.
 
 These public housing units have a very high rate of infection — at least one in 100 residents have already tested positive.
 
 What’s more, it seems some people weren’t following the rules to protect others. Andrews admitted there were “language and cultural barriers”, and he hasn’t posted police on every floor because he trusts residents to do the right thing.
 
 The lockdown, he said, was because of all the shared facilities in the towers, plus “patterns of movement, friendship groups, family groups”.
 
 As I said here two weeks ago, our multicultural diversity is not a strength but a weakness in this crisis.
 
 But is Daniel Andrews actually groping at last towards the kind of strategy we need to fight a virus that will be with Australians for many months, and maybe years?
 
 True, this latest lockdown — of 12 postcodes plus these nine towers — is more targeted than his earlier statewide bans. Schools, for instance, can stay open this time, even in the affected suburbs.
 
 But it is still not targeted enough.
 
 Crackdowns like this on even the non-infected cannot be our response each time there is an outbreak. They are too devastating a “cure”.
 
 As I said in March, we need police and the army to help quarantine the sick and potentially infectious, while we isolate the vulnerable — the frail and people over 65.
 
 But let everyone else get back to work, or stay at home if they don’t dare. Let people decide for themselves what risk they are prepared to run.
 
 I quote myself to show I’m not just being wise after the event, and that too many of our politicians failed to be wise at the time.
 
 Andrews was the least wise of all. He was tough with bans that were useless, but failed to be tough with what worked.
 
 The virus got out because he got private security guards — amateurs — to run our quarantine hotels, only to catch the virus themselves from returning travellers. He even let travellers leave those hotels without being tested. Then his police did not check that those infected stayed home and didn’t go out.
 
 With 108 new infections in Victoria on Saturday and 74 yesterday, Andrews is desperate to do something dramatic to regain control, but he’s still locking up too many people who are virus-free.
 
 Please — lock up the sick and lock down the vulnerable.
 
 But let the rest of us live a life. Remember, despite the panic, just 104 Australians have died from this virus. Most were 80 or older, and many already very frail or sick.
 
 About as frail as Dictator Dan’s commitment to freedom.

212,Learning harsh economic lessons during pandemic,News,2021-11-09T15:14:23.797Z,"Reopening schools will limit long-term damage to students
 
 Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan indulged an immense frustration on Sunday when he accused Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews of showing a “failure of leadership” by not having a plan to reopen schools in term two. Mr Tehan’s language may have been sharp, but it was not as severe as the damage he risked to the national consensus on restarting learning in the classroom. Scott Morrison quickly pulled his loose minister into line. Mr Tehan apologised for overstepping the mark. The next day, Mr Andrews said the comments were “ancient history”. Move along, please. Spats between consenting egos aside, Canberra has a point: children should be back at school. It’s essential for their progress and wellbeing. New studies show students living in poverty and those with a learning disability are most vulnerable in the shutdown. The danger is growing inequality, misery and lifelong damage.
 
 Reopening schools is critical for the broader community, too. New Treasury analysis presented to national cabinet shows classroom closures have led to more than 300,000 job losses and ripped 3 per cent off our gross domestic product. The Prime Minister says those hard numbers put “enormous pressure” on the timetable to move us back to a COVID-safe economy. Getting kids to school frees up their parents, especially mothers. It will boost productivity and GDP. Although it does not run schools, Canberra is waving a $3.3bn carrot to non-government schools to reopen campuses and return to at least 50 per cent classroom teaching before the end of the month. Mr Morrison has been steadfast, rather than stubborn, on schools. Yet it is up to premiers and chief ministers, who take responsibility for schools, to make the tough calls.
 
 Around the nation, authorities are reopening schools in a sequenced way. From Monday, NSW students will be back in the classroom, starting with a day or two of school-based tuition each week. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the flexible approach means authorities can respond quickly to new spikes in the spread of COVID-19. Queensland students will also be back on Monday, with prep, Year 1 and Years 11 and 12 to return first; if that goes well, all students would return to classrooms from May 25. In South Australia and Western Australia, students returned to class last week, although about a third continued to learn from home. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein urged parents to keep their children at home if they could. All Northern Territory schools are open.
 
 But in Victoria and the ACT, there is no return date for government schools, although many private schools are back. In Victoria, parents have been told that all students who can learn from home must continue to do so. Those who cannot should attend their normal school. Still, there is some light at the end of the Zoom call: Mr Andrews is open to the idea of a return this term if the medical evidence supports the move. On this score, however, the advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee has not changed. On Wednesday, Mr Morrison noted that COVID-19 had a very low rate of transmission and movement between children, particularly when it came to severe cases. “Children can safely go to school, schools have always been safe to fully open,” he said. “You’ve got to make sure that workplace for those who work in it, for the teachers, others, is safe.” Of course that applies to any workplace as restrictions are eased. Nev Power’s COVID-19 Commission is working with employers and unions to develop tools for businesses to be able to open, keeping patrons and workers safe. Yet schools are different to, say, supermarkets or public transport. Teachers are exposed to kids in the confines of a classroom for extended periods; a classroom is an up close and personal environment; kids often don’t respect personal space. Protecting teachers from infection will require new protocols. In France, for instance, class sizes will be limited to 15; masks are obligatory for high school students; and teachers are encouraged to wear masks. School cleaning must be extended and improved. Older teachers, or those with health issues, should be rostered to minimise risks to them. The broader, faster, asymptomatic testing regime must be extended to all teachers, and possibly to their families.Federal, state and territory leaders have pledged to having a “sustainable COVID-19-safe economy by July”, subject to adequate testing, tracing and local surge health response capacity. On Friday, national cabinet is set to issue a three-step framework to remove baseline restrictions. That will give people a sense of what life will be like over the next few months. The longer school restrictions remain in place, the more it will hurt students; those in early childhood and elementary levels could be most affected, as well as the already disadvantaged. We know over the five weeks to April 18, almost one million jobs were lost; unemployment is rising fast. Each week of shutdown is costing us $4bn in lost productivity, workforce participation and consumption. Sadly, as Mr Morrison says, those are the facts. Our nation is being homeschooled in the harsh lessons of a pandemic.",884
213,LEFT’S VIEW SHOWS IT’S TIME FOR ANOTHER LABOR SPLIT,News,2021-07-13T18:20:27.242Z,"The ALP needs a faction that champions the welfare of ordinary wage-earners
 
 Labor Left factional heavy Mark Butler used me to try to score a politic­al point against Scott Morrison in parliament this week.
 
 Apparently Energy Minister Angus Taylor shouldn’t be at an event with me because of my scepticism of the net benefits of long, blanket lockdowns to counter corona­virus.
 
 In an earlier era, the left would have been far more attuned to the impact of lockdowns on the young and poor at home, and their far worse impact on developing ­nations that depend on a strong global economy to lift their own citizens of poverty.
 
 Indeed, in an earlier era I would have been the sort of person Labor might have wanted on board: son of a union representative (for the old Printing and Kindred Industri­es Union), the first to finish­ high school on both sides of my family.
 
 The coronavirus pandemic and Black Lives Matter movement have highlighted how shallow and inconsistent so-called left-wing advocacy has become. It’s not a place for people like me any more.
 
 The common theme is now sanctimony, vast reservoirs of it, divorced from the complexity of life and the trade-offs policy entails­. That was once a hallmark of aristocrats and clergy.
 
 Giving black students at elite universities extra marks if they are “traumatised” about the death of George Floyd would have been a lower priority than arresting declinin­g life expectancy of poor white Americans for a previous generation of leftists. Don’t expect to hear about a protest for them.
 
 In that generation, one’s econo­mic­ circumstances mattered more than one’s sexuality, gender or race, which reveal little about one’s character, history or power. The old left would have preferred to save the lives of the poor and young in the Third World than the old and rich in advanced countries. Workers of the world, unite, has become retirees, unite!
 
 David Beasley, executive director of the UN’s World Food Program­, warned in April that millions could starve as a result of the economic slump induced by the hysterical response to the coronavirus by advanc­ed countries.
 
 Famine could kill more than the 454,000 who have died so far from COVID-19, which remains a tiny share of the 60 million in annual deaths from all causes.
 
 Sunetra Gupta, an Oxford epidemiologist who has been an opponen­t of lockdowns, told The Wall Street Journal recently that the costs of lockdowns were “not in proportion”.
 
 “I’m reading about migrant workers walking home over hundreds of miles, dying on the way,” she says, referring to her native India, where hundreds of migrant workers, now jobless, have died.
 
 More than 100 million Ethiop­ians, with a life expectancy of 66, probably have more important things to worry about than a virus that increases your chance of dy­ing in your 80s by a small amount.
 
 That’s why the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who has replaced US President Donald Trump as the left’s bogeyman, has been reluctant to smash his economy with lockdowns. In any case, try shutting down a favela.
 
 Even ignoring the devastating impact of the lockdowns on the developi­ng world, the left’s “whatever it takes” attitude to protecting the elderly at any cost sits bizarrely with other policy stances.
 
 For Labor, the physical wellbeing of the elderly is suddenly paramount, but not their financial wellbeing, having fought for years to make their franking credits non-refundable.
 
 If extending life trumps all other considerations, then why are abortion and euthanasia often so high on the progressive wish list? If you believe the world is over­popul­ated, as the Greens do, then causing a massive recession to stop a disease that shortens lives a little doesn’t stack up.
 
 The left professes concern about inequality but lockdowns will exacerbate it. It’s the white-collar workers who keep their jobs and incomes. The poor and itinerant workers will become un­employed more easily, and suffer the accompanying indignity. Youth unemployment has surged, and job opportunities have been crushed for a generation of young people in their 20s.
 
 Meanwhile, the price of assets, owned almost exclusively by the well-off, are surging as central banks “print money” to prop up their economies, egged on by a left besotted with modern monetary theory.
 
 In any case, poorer households have less to fear from the coronavirus itself. In the US at least, men at the 80th percentile of income distribution live nine years longer than those at the 20th percentile, who tend to die at 75.
 
 Ben Chifley would be shocked at how little concern for the working poor remains. Labor MP Kristina Keneally was recently castigated by her own side for suggesti­ng a reduction in immig­ration as a way to shore up wages.
 
 The light on the hill has become a disco ball in a gay nightclub, with race-based entry caps.
 
 To the extent the left represents a coherent class, it’s the growing part of the middle class that lives off the state: what sociologist Joel Kotkin calls “the clerisy” and what economist Thomas Piketty calls the “Brahmin left”.
 
 These are the university-educated bureaucrats, teachers, public health advocates, consultants and executives dependent on government contracts, et cetera, whose incomes­ are far more stable. Lockdowns have enriched this class financia­lly and socially.
 
 For the other part of the middle class — small-business owners and independent professionals — they have been a disaster. As it becomes clearer that COVID-19 is not as lethal as feared, calls for tough public health measures look as if they are more about hurting the private economy to pave the way for a fattened-up clerisy than saving lives.
 
 In Australia, the Labor Party has split three times in its history: over conscription in 1915, money printing in the early 1930s and communism after World War II.
 
 It’s time for a fourth split: Labor needs a faction that champions the welfare of ordinary wage-earners in the private sector, who outnumber the clerisy by a large margin. It would advocate huge cuts in income tax for ordinary workers, shifting more of the burden on the wealthy. And voluntary superannuation would give workers the freedom to avoid being gouged by the financial sector and have a better life while young, in case coronavirus claims them at 80. People like me would join that faction.",1105

215,Let’s tear it all down at the dawn of Great Awokening,News,2020-11-18T22:48:22.384Z,"Race protests have morphed into an assault on democracy HBO Max pulls Gone With the Wind from its streaming service. Cranks are burning and composting JK Rowling’s Harry Potter books. Winston Churchill’s statue is defaced. A staff hissy fit over an opinion article at The New York Times forces an editor to quit. The intolerable killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis has lit fires for all manner of intolerances, under the banners of racial equality and identity politics. While calling for compassion and tolerance, activists intimidate and destroy. In another week in the creep of the “woke” state, where social media police drop a knee on freedoms and thoughts are cancelled as easily as a swipe and delete, ordinary people could think the world is off kilter.
 
  Never mind that we are in a cook-off between great powers, economies are shrinking and the coronavirus is sweeping the globe; someone, somewhere is threatened by an opinion that’s different, outraged by a historical relic, triggered by works of art, films, books and their creators. Control + alt + delete is a pathology.
 
 A horrible death in Minneapolis has unleashed a scramble for moral supremacy. The fight is not waged in a robust contest of ideas but through the silencing, deplatforming, bullying and defaming of opponents. It’s a brazen attempt to overthrow what we value in liberal democracy by those who slander it as a system of minority oppression and impoverishment. An ordinary person, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, may wonder: How did we get to this miserable place? Yet liberalism has been under assault for some time, from within universities and political parties, by oligopolist tech titans and those with control of the cultural ramparts.
 
 It’s acute in the US, as Paul Kelly detailed in Inquirer last week, with polarisation at the extremes and a hollowing out of the political centre, with its middle-class suburban stability, anchor of family life, aspiration and widely shared cultural norms. Beneath this is a crisis in liberalism. “The new age of rising anger and grievance is defined by excessive individualism and the relentless rise of subcultures, both trends advanced by technology,” Kelly argued. “These are the killing agents stalking the liberal order.” The killing of Floyd has exposed an America where trust has evaporated. As US social psychologist Jonathan Haidt observed, the battle between conservatives and progressives is a struggle between “different cultures”, with a descent into tribal identities and inter-group conflicts a threat to democracy itself.
 
 This degradation has its roots in the progressive takeover of universities in the West. The dominant fashions of postmodernism and critical theory junked any pretence of searching for the truth or objectivity, opening the space for rampant identity politics, purity tests and the shutdown of free speech. The arrival on campus at the turn of the century of millennials, followed soon after by younger, anxious snowflake siblings, supercharged the dynamic. Some have labelled it the “Great Awokening”. These students were showing us what would happen when social media became the public square for democracy at a time of collapse of mainstream media, cyber trolling by China and Russia, and the rise of fake news. What started as a cult, if not quite a culture, of safe spaces, aversion to criticism, thought policing and primacy of identity in the social sciences has taken hold in all institutions, especially education, media, the public sector, corporations, even science, health and medicine.
 
 Rather than being institutions of open debate, rigorous inquiry and academic freedom, universities have quickly succumbed to the tyranny of “diversity” and the perversion of scientific method. We see it here in different guises and fields, and in the legal travails of Peter Ridd at James Cook University and Drew Pavlou at the University of Queensland. As well, universities have been at the forefront of the “diversity industrial complex”, pledging “gender equity” and other fads. Diversity, in this instance, is simply identity politics with critical theory and anti-capitalist overtones, rather than a multiplicity of viewpoints. Even in times of financial crisis, universities protect these bloated, feel-good bureaucracies, which are at odds with learning, inquiry and freedom.
 
 But the mainstream is waking up to what is going on in these citadels, with the riots, cancellations and lily-livered responses by culture controllers signalling a tipping point. The lunacy has spilled into crusades to defund police departments, tear down statues of dead “oppressors” like Cecil Rhodes and James Cook, purge platforms of comedies such as Little Britain and Chris Lilley’s satires, and push wacky “critical race theories” that the West is “structurally racist”. Apart from being boring, corrosive and limiting, this is dangerous, dodgy terrain. On Friday art photographer Bill Henson called this out as “fascist revisionism”, seeing parallels with Pol Pot’s Year Zero and the Cultural Revolution in China. He argued Mao Zedong — who said, “We must abolish the Four Olds: old customs, old culture, old habits and old ideas” — was a “precedent for these millennial tantrums”.
 
 In the news business, the malaise is a symptom and cause of decline. In the Philadelphia Inquirer, a headline — Buildings Matter, Too — over a story by its architecture critic in the wake of damage to buildings from rioting, hastened the end for its top editor. Staff members saw it as an affront to the Black Lives Matter cause. The woke rebellion at The New York Times was over publication of a piece by Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who called for troops to be sent in to restore order in US cities, an opinion shared by millions of Americans. The journalistic bastion, whose mission is “All the news that’s fit to print”, is in schism. As columnist Bari Weiss noted, it’s a split between mature libertarians, who put an emphasis on the “all” of its motto, and young progressives fixated on narrowing the meaning of “fit”. These baby merchants of truth and punishment were triggered by Senator Cotton’s opinions.
 
 Imagine working for perhaps the most influential US media outlet and needing a safe space from ideas, history or reality? It’s OK because the new NYT opinion chief advised staff that anyone who finds “any piece of Opinion journalism — including headlines or social posts or photos or you name it — that gives you the slightest pause, please call or text me immediately”. Get me my blanky! As The Wall Street Journal duly noted, the resignations of two editors were another milestone in the march of identity politics and cancel culture through liberal institutions. “The agents of this politics now dominate nearly all of America’s leading cultural institutions — museums, philanthropy, Hollywood, book publishers, even late-night talk shows,” the Journal editorialised. At home, whether it’s in the coverage of US riots, local protests, trials of culture war enemies such as George Pell, or the meat, potatoes and organic greens of politics and policy, your ABC is similarly afflicted. This mulishness leads to blind spots and a lack of curiosity, with these activist-friendly news brands completely missing the forces behind, say, Brexit and the 2016 election of Donald Trump.
 
 As we’re seeing in the rush to topple monuments, cancel culture shows a profound failure to understand history, where horror and glory are intertwined, often in the same person, and great civilisations have atrocious failings, including near universal slavery. The revival of unironic cheer squads for socialism among Gen Z, who drop “Nazi” as a weapon like grandparents dropped acid, is dispiriting. They clearly know nothing of communism and the bastard symbiosis between Nazis and Stalinists. There’s narcissism at play, for sure, but also a wilful, luxuriant ignorance of history. Anyway, why over-think a slogan, hashtag or meme? As Geoffrey Blainey argues in Inquirer the essence of studying history is to try to see the obstacles and dilemmas people of the past struggled against or evaded. “We also hope that the future will try to understand why we made blunders, and learn from failures and achievements of our era,” he writes. Amid the tumult, this time of the Great Awokening, there are signs people are pushing back against the tide of despair and rage, of dismal forgetting and fracturing. One is in the sheer ridiculousness of these excesses. Frankly, the mainstream, as opposed to vice-chancellors and chief executives, will never give a damn about activist pieties. On many measures, the world has never been a better or safer place, although COVID-19 has shocked us out of any complacency about risks to health and harmony. Our enduring values are from the Enlightenment, where science, technology and reason prevailed. That legacy is not completely lost, nor faith in democracy. But we need running repairs, emphasising open inquiry, civil debate, the virtues of liberalism in all its manifestations, and the power of individuals to promote that reform. The zealots of the Zeitgeist — mad, bad and dangerous to know, as Lord Byron’s lover once described him — are prone to overreach and hubris. Like other despots, they can still be toppled by evidence, reality, reason and informed democratic consent.",1534
216,Lives matter too much to be put at risk by protesters,News,2020-06-15T21:28:26.590Z,"‘I can’t breathe’ will remain a catchcry for human rights The right to protest peacefully is intrinsic to Australia’s democratic heritage, although important freedoms have been suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep us safe from disease. We acknowledge that racial inequality is a serious problem on both sides of the Pacific. Under current circumstances, however, as the nation recovers from the coronavirus, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian made the right call in declaring illegal the Black Lives Matter protest planned for Sydney on Saturday.
 
 The planned scale of the event had grown during the course of the week, as she said, which meant organisers could not guarantee safe social distancing. The expert medical panel advising national cabinet also is “extremely concerned”, for good reason, that the protests, which will proceed in other major cities, carry the risk of a “major resurgence” of coronavirus cases. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy has reminded the public that a single person infected with the virus infects 35 others.
 
 Beyond NSW, confusion is rife. In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews has urged the public to avoid the protest. Victoria Police plan to fine organisers but not participants for breaches of COVID-19 restrictions at the event.
 
 In Queensland, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has urged people to stay home but stopped short of urging police to arrest those who turn up and disobey the law, saying: “That is a matter for police.” In South Australia, club and junior sport remain banned but Police Commissioner Grant Stevens has irked many by giving protest organisers an exemption from social distancing rules. As David Penberthy writes, premiers hiding behind the skirts of their police commissioners are abrogating their responsibilities. In Sydney, Liberal councillor Christine Forster summed up many people’s views: “If you can protest … then you should be allowed to go to the footy.” The fence-sitting of most premiers makes a mockery of their insistence on social restrictions over recent months, especially the overzealous continuation of border closures by some. From the outset of the pandemic, health authorities have cautioned that indigenous people, who tend to suffer poorer health than non-indigenous people, were at higher risk from the coronavirus. That also has proven to be the case in the US, where African-Americans have died from COVID-19 at three times the rate of white Americans. In Australia, it would be tragic if Aborigines joining protests for a better deal for their people caught the deadly virus and infected vulnerable family and friends.
 
 Aside from the vexed issues surrounding the protests, the killing of George Floyd as he gasped his last words — “I can’t breathe” — was an unconscionable act of racial violence and abuse of police power. It has rightly galvanised attention on racial inequality. It is a “national shame”, as Scott Morrison says, that at least 432 indigenous Australians have died in custody since the 1991 royal commission, with only two-thirds of its recommendations implemented. On Friday, Brisbane barrister Joshua Creamer reminded our readers that a common element of many Aboriginal deaths in custody cases was “the complete disregard shown for their lives — a sense of them being less worthy of humane treatment because they are Aboriginal”. And as opposition frontbencher Andrew Leigh said last year, a higher percentage of indigenous Australian adults are incarcerated than African-Americans in the US. That worrying point needs to be taken into account in Closing the Gap strategies for advancing practical reconciliation, a process strongly backed by this newspaper for decades. Mr Floyd’s death unleashed a torrid week of violent riots across the US, which remains in far more dire straits from COVID-19 than Australia ever reached. US cities have descended into lawlessness in a way Australians would be horrified to see here. The problems gripping our closest ally, as Henry Ergas has written, are not the harbinger of US collapse. But they point to divides that have remained unhealed for decades. Because black and white lives matter, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt’s advice to Australians deserves to be taken seriously: “Exercise your compassion. Express yourself. But do it in a way which is safe, sound and respectful of our most vulnerable Australians.”",713
217,MANAGE RISK FOR SOCIETY’S REWARD,News,2020-03-21T12:10:02.508Z,"Like the virus, we must discriminate to focus resources
 
 The virus is discriminating among us and so should we.
 
 The 1918-19 Spanish flu outbreak was extraordinarily discriminatory. In the US, 99 per cent of the 500,000 or more who died were under the age of 65, and almost half were between 20 and 40.
 
 COVID-19 also is discriminating among us, but in the opposite direction. Data for the first 60,850 confirmed cases in New York City (to 7am Sunday AEST) show that of 2254 patients who have died, 70 per cent were over 65. A further 22 per cent were under 65 but with major risk factors, including diabetes, lung disease, immunodeficiency, cancer and heart disease. As in China, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, infections among these groups are bringing overwhelming pressure to bear on intensive care units.
 
 Australia’s national cabinet has identified the shortage of ICU facilities as the most pressing health issue facing the nation. But the instrument it has chosen to alleviate the problem — social distancing of all but those engaged in essential services — is much too blunt.
 
 Like the virus, we need to discriminate. We need to focus our attention on minimising the rate of infection among those who have the greatest potential to swamp our ICU facilities: those over 65 and those younger than 65 but with known risk factors.
 
 For these two groups, we need to move beyond social distancing and into total lockdown, delivering food and essential services to their homes, and rigorously excluding any outside contacts, including with their loved ones. And for those visitors they need for their survival — aged-care staff, for example — we need to put in place meticulous daily screening programs.
 
 But such stringent measures should be applied only to those over 65 or with defined risk factors.
 
 For other Australians, the greatest threat to lives and livelihoods is not the virus but the long-term economic, social and psychological impact of unemployment and loss of educational opportunities.
 
 For these Australians, we should be planning to ease off the brakes. Starting with the lowest risk cohort — those under 45 — we should aim to get them back to school and work as soon as the curve begins to flatten. Let’s aim for the end of the school holidays.
 
 But first we need a second layer of discrimination, along the same lines that have proved so successful in Singapore: mandatory temperature checks on all individuals seeking to enter office blocks, schools or shopping centres, followed by diagnostic testing and contact tracing wherever appropriate.
 
 None of this will be without adverse effects. Many under-45s will contract the virus and some of them may require hospitalisation. They should have first priority, after frontline health professionals, for hospital beds and ICU facilities.
 
 But the advantages of this course of action clearly outweigh the disadvantages. They include a level of herd immunity that ultimately will protect everybody, including the most vulnerable in our community, and the reversal of the economic and social consequences that threaten our entire society.

218,Missing middle' leaves too many in the dark,Fairfax,2021-01-08T11:25:01.696Z,"Martin Foley, Victoria's Minister for Mental Health, said recently that the state's mental health system ""wasn't fit for purpose"" - in a rare moment of political truth-telling. He said it as the COVID-19 pandemic set itself to test the fitness of the mental health system in the same way it has tested our aged care, childcare and hospital systems.
 
 The mental health fallout from the pandemic has a long way to run, but we are starting to see its impact. Deartment of Health and Human Services data shows that more people are presenting to emergency departments after harming themselves, and Eli Lilly, maker of the antidepressant Prozac, has reported shortages of the drug because of increased demand.
 
 One of the reasons the mental health system is vulnerable is because shared funding between state and federal governments leaves large gaps. The state government funds public hospital units and community care for people with severe mental illnesses. Funding for this system has steadily eroded in Victoria, to the extent that the state has the lowest per capita expenditure on mental health care and the lowest number of beds. Community care is difficult to access. It is restricted mainly to people with severe psychotic illnesses, or who are considered at high risk of harming themselves or others. The people who are provided with care very definitely need it, but so do many others who cannot clear the bar to qualify for it.
 
 Those who can't access care via the state government mental health services can attempt to get care via Medicare-funded services. General practitioners provide much of it, and they can organise referrals to psychiatrists, psychologists and other allied health clinicians. Mental health clinicians are concentrated in wealthier suburbs, where they can charge higher fees and see patients who more often have less complicated problems. Access to them requires that a person has the wherewithal to organise a referral, the capacity to pay the gap between what the clinician charges and what Medicare reimburses, and the ability to organise themselves to attend regular appointments. This is beyond many.
 
 The ""missing middle"" has been coined to describe people who fall in the gap between what the state and federally funded systems can provide. These are people who aren't considered unwell enough to get care in state-funded mental health services but who can't access Medicare-funded care or don't benefit from it.
 
 Many people in the missing middle have complex mental health problems, exacerbated by poverty and other social disadvantages. They might have problems with depression, anxiety, problematic use of alcohol and other drugs, difficulties in their relationships, unemployment, and unstable accommodation. They need much more than a GP or psychologist, despite their best intentions, can provide. They would benefit from the multi-disciplinary care provided by their local mental health service but unless they have demonstrated that they are at imminent risk are unlikely to be provided with it.
 
 This group are likely to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic, which will exacerbate their financial stresses and erode their social supports. We need new ways of thinking to provide them with the mental health care they need.
 
 Greg Hunt's announcement on Monday of $32 million for mental health services in Victoria is timely, and we might hope the first step towards more substantial federal government investment in our mental health system. While the details haven't been made available, he said the funding would provide 12 months of support for 15 new mental health centres around Victoria. They would be established in close connection with GP clinics, and would house psychologists, social workers and mental health nurses to provide support.
 
 The model appears to build on the success of the federally funded headspace centres for adolescents and young adults. The government funds the infrastructure for clinical services, and practitioners then offer Medicare-subsidised care to young people.
 
 Significantly, Hunt also proposed a joint Victorian Mental Health Taskforce between the federal and state governments. This recognition of the need for both sides to work together to close the gap in mental health care is important. These are small steps, but we can hope they are the first in the more substantial reform needed to address the missing middle.

220,No Australian life is expendable,Fairfax,2020-05-24T09:25:28.905Z,"Factoring in a loss of lives for the sake of the economy runs counter to the society we want to be.
 
 It's easier to walk into a maze than it is to walk out. Once the coronavirus started arriving here by plane and cruise ship just a few months ago, what needed to be done gradually made itself clear: we had to shut down as much of our normal activity as possible. For how long, no one really knew. We still don't know. When I say ""we"", I mean governments as well as ordinary Australians.
 
 Now that we're not quite all the way into lockdown mode but somewhere near it, our lives are in the hands of our political leaders and those who advise them to a greater extent than at any time since World War Two. What's been done up till now is having a positive effect. There's some success at pushing back at COVID-19, although it's still taking lives and making too many of us incredibly sick.
 
 However, the great challenge is still ahead of us: when and how do we start to relax the restrictions governing our movements, our income, our businesses, our education and our health?
 
 At this stage, while the mandatory self-isolation phase is still a bit of a novelty and the Easter holiday even in these straitened times gives life a rosy glow, the reopening issue looks like a discussion point. But what we're living through today and for at least the rest of 2020 is not a drill. A succession of hard decisions is coming.
 
 Increasingly during the past week or so there's been urging from some sections of the business community and from parts of the media to roll back the restrictions soon because the toll on the economy is becoming too great. This is clothed in the contemporary language of wellness, with its advocates reminding us that recessions have harmful health and social effects, too - suicide, drug addiction, family violence and so on.
 
 The solution put forward is to get our younger workers back out there and to wind back some of the restrictions, all to start the economic recovery. The argument is accompanied by suggestions of safeguards for the vulnerable, such as effectively locking up everyone over, say, 70 and delivering services to them while also instantaneously boosting our health system.
 
 There's no question that the personal and financial cost of the economic shutdown is enormous and appalling. But surely either gambling with the lives of fellow Australians or consciously factoring in the loss of a few oldies, or even some unfortunate younger ones, on the way to reviving the economy runs counter to the values of the society that we should strive to be.
 
 The world has instantly become awash with autodidactic epidemiologists who hang all their hopes on the creation of herd immunity. The main message from real epidemiologists is that they just don't know enough yet about COVID-19, which should be no surprise, given how recently it appeared. Immunity might not be possible. Re-infection might be a feature of this virus.
 
 It's not as if this new form of coronavirus knows our birthdates and selectively picks us off according to our pensioner or superannuant status. It goes looking for every host it can find and just happens to have greater success with those of us in our seventh decade and beyond.
 
 Why? Older people are the most vulnerable because their bodies have started to break down; they are weakened. But they're not the only ones who are weakened. Cancer patients, the disabled, people living with multiple sclerosis or cardio-pulmonary problems or other chronic illnesses - these and many others are part of that cohort. What happens to them as the virus starts to move around the community again?
 
 It's a cliche to say that every society should be judged by how well it looks after its weakest members, those who most need protection, but cliches generally start out as truths. No matter how many precautions are taken once the current restrictions are relaxed, all of these weaker groups will be in greater danger of falling victim to COVID-19. It would be interesting to know how many 35-year-old breast cancer sufferers with a couple of young kids should be included in the list of potential human sacrifices.
 
 Then there are those who aren't weakened or burdened by comorbidities who'll be expected to endure greater exposure to the coronavirus in the first stages of society's liberation. Doctors, nurses, paramedics, other workers who keep the hospitals running. Allied health professionals. Emergency services workers. Those who make our homes and streets operational by collecting our rubbish or maintain our utilities.
 
 The federal government and the states, having led us by necessity into this maze, have the responsibility of making the calls on leading us out. Surely their guiding principle on that journey should be that no Australian should ever be regarded as expendable.
 
 Most of us are familiar with the concept of the good death - the exiting from this life based on the expression of our values and needs. But the COVID-19 pandemic is introducing us to the concept of a good number of deaths. This should be resisted. No matter what we'll be told by the urgers, an economy should always exist to serve a society, not the other way around.

221,No reason to go soft on hate,Fairfax,2020-10-31T07:44:01.382Z,"Imagine what would happen if you were to raise the black flag of Islamic State high over your house. Chances are you'd be arrested and charged for a terrorism-related offence.
 
 Imagine, then, if you were to display Nazi symbols. Say, you were to raise a swastika-emblazoned flag. Would you be arrested and charged for an offence?
 
 This isn't a hypothetical question for the town of Beulah in north-west Victoria. And the answer, it seems, is no. There, Cheryl Lawdorn and her partner flew a Nazi flag in their backyard for several weeks. According to media reports, Lawdorn defended the flag by saying she had German ancestry.
 
 Despite widespread public condemnation, the couple has so far escaped any formal sanction (though they have now taken the flag down). Victorian authorities find themselves in a bind. The abhorrence of Nazi symbols aside, there seem to be few legal grounds for authorities to take any action.
 
 That's because the Victorian criminal law only extends to offences aimed directly at the person or at property. It doesn't cover the advocacy of racial supremacy.
 
 And while the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act makes it unlawful to incite hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule of others based on race and religion, it has only been used infrequently with success. Courts have imposed a high threshold on what constitutes unlawful hatred, contempt or ridicule.
 
 Given the marked rise in anti-Semitism and white supremacy, there is understandable community concern in Victoria. What good is a law against racial hatred if it can't be used in response to the advocacy of Nazism? How else would you describe the public flying of a Nazi flag?
 
 Similar questions have been raised in NSW. Back in 2015, the limits of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act were also dramatically exposed. In a speech to a rally in Sydney, Ismail Al-Wahwah, the leader of the Islamic movement Hizb ut-Tahrir, endorsed a ""jihad against Jews"".
 
 Yet even this wasn't enough to result in action. The NSW Director of Public Prosecution declined to prosecute Al-Wahwah under section 20D of the Anti-Discrimination Act. Over three decades, the DPP had never prosecuted a case of racial vilification, despite 30 opportunities to do so.
 
 This has since been remedied in NSW. In 2018, as a result of a campaign from multicultural communities, the NSW government repealed section 20D. It amended the NSW Crimes Act to make public threats or incitement of violence (including on the grounds of race, religion and sexual orientation) a criminal offence.
 
 Victorian legislators could opt for something like this, or lower the threshold of existing vilification legislation. Or they could even opt to ban the Nazi flag or symbol, as some European countries do.
 
 But there's one thing that has been overlooked so far. While it's clear that the Victorian legislation is flawed, few remember there's another instrument for responding to racial hatred: the federal Racial Discrimination Act.
 
 Under section 18C of that legislation, it is unlawful to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate other people on the grounds of their race. There have been many notable occasions when the provision has been used to hold acts of racial hatred (including anti-Semitism) to account.
 
 I'll be the first to say I'm weary of debates about free speech and the Racial Discrimination Act. In the five years I was race discrimination commissioner, the federal government twice tried to weaken section 18C. On both occasions, the proposed changes to the law would have turned 18C into the very limited kind of protections that exist under state anti-discrimination laws.
 
 The federal government, both times, failed. Still, some damage was done.
 
 Sustained assaults on the legislation have had a chilling effect on the targets of racism. Many know all too well that certain media outlets are obsessed with campaigns against anti-discrimination law. Few people targeted by racism want to be subjected to the kind of public scrutiny that may accompany making a formal complaint about racial hatred.
 
 The right-wing culture war has also encouraged the active denial of racism's persistence (the other denialism going around). This is often accompanied by dismissals of official anti-racism. For many conservatives, no law can ever banish prejudice. Therefore, rather than limiting hate speech, they argue we should simply counter ignorance and malice through more ""good speech"".
 
 This threatens to shift our society's default position on racism and bigotry. But there's simply no good reason to be going soft on hatred.
 
 After all, there are just some things we mustn't tolerate or think we can counter through reason. We wouldn't be debating our toleration of IS flags; we wouldn't for a moment believe we could only counter IS extremists through ""good speech"".
 
 Well, we shouldn't be doing it either with Nazi flags and those who fly them.

222,"ONCE AGAIN, BILL MISSES THE MARK",News,2021-07-14T21:34:40.570Z,"Reworked draft religious freedom laws are not fit to be passed by parliament The Morrison government has spent many months working and reworking its attempt to better protect religious belief. Its efforts are worthy because religious freedom receives inadequate protection and deserves to be recognised as one of the basic rights held by all Australians. Unfortunately, the way the government has gone about this task is seriously misguided.
 
 The government’s initial bill was widely criticised and then shelved. The second draft was issued a few weeks before Christmas for a further period of public consultation that closed last Friday. It is clear from the submissions and public comments made by a wide section of the community, including business, civil society groups and religious organisations, that the government has again missed the mark. Its second bill is not fit to be passed by parliament.
 
 Much of the government’s religious discrimination bill is sensible and unobjectionable. The law prohibits discrimination against a person because of their religious belief and practices. For example, it would be unlawful to deny a person a job or a promotion because they are a Buddhist.
 
 The protection also extends to education, access to premises, the provision of goods and services, accommodation, sport and clubs. The bill would protect religious belief from discrimination in a similar way to what is already in place for race, sex, age and disability.
 
 If the government had stopped there, the bill could be enacted. Unfortunately, it has gone much further in seeking to provide an unprecedented and quite remarkable set of additional rights to religious organisations that are not provided to other members of the community. Two clauses cause particular concern.
 
 Section 11 says that the anti-discrimination protections in the bill do not apply when a religious body engages in conduct in good faith in accordance with its doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings. This includes a right to discriminate against someone to “avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents” to the religion.
 
 This clause reverses the primary object of the legislation. It permits one person to be discriminated against on account of their religious belief because such discrimination is in keeping with another person’s religion. For example, a Christian health facility could deny employment to a Jewish doctor, or a Muslim accommodation provider might deny services to non-Muslims.
 
 These types of authorisations are dangerous and erode community cohesion. They are especially troubling given the widespread provision of goods and services across health, housing and aged care by religious bodies.
 
 The law would permit many essential goods and services, including those supported by taxpayer dollars, to be made subject to religious tests and qualifications.
 
 There are sensible ways in which religions can operate in accordance with their beliefs, but this provision goes well beyond that.
 
 The full extent of the licence to discriminate provided by section 11 is unclear.
 
 This is because other anti-discrimination laws would continue to operate, and the interaction between those and this new law is complex. The result will be grey areas when a person’s race, sex, age or disability is involved. This uncertainty will need to be resolved through legal advice and court cases.
 
 The second problematic clause provides protection to religious speech over and above other forms of speech. Section 42 cuts a swath through federal and state discrimination laws in establishing that statements of belief based upon a person’s religion do not amount to discrimination.
 
 Such statements are protected so long as they are not malicious, do not encourage others to commit a serious crime and do not “harass, threaten, seriously intimidate or vilify” another person or group.
 
 This section is ill-conceived. It is wrong as a matter of principle to use the law to prioritise one form of speech over another. In this case it would mean that religious speech receives special legal protection that is not accorded to speech by the press or other members of the community. One person could make a statement in accordance with their religious beliefs that another non-religious person could not. This is not appropriate in a democracy that prizes all forms of speech.
 
 The provision is also troubling because it allows people to rely on their religious beliefs to make statements that humiliate or intimidate others in the workplace, in school, on public transport or in any setting. For example, a person could rely upon the clause to make anti-Semitic taunts on a bus, to abuse another child in the playground because their parents are same-sex married, or to ridicule and belittle a co-worker because they are divorced.
 
 The government has it wrong again with this second attempt at a religious discrimination law. The law should be aimed at fostering harmony in the community based upon tolerance and respect for different beliefs.
 
 Instead, it threatens to sow division and to embolden people to attack others in personal and hurtful ways under the cloak of religion. A third attempt at protecting religious belief is needed.George Williams is dean of law at the University of NSW.",860
223,ONLINE CHILD SEX ABUSE SHAMES US,News,2021-07-09T20:24:04.658Z,"Parents need to be wary of predators targeting children in our homes It is a dreadful statistic and we should be ashamed of it. Research indicates Australia is the third largest consumer of live, online child sexual abuse.
 
 And with overseas travel grounded because of COVID-19, it is likely more depraved individuals are paying for live-streamed, pay-per-view child abuse and rape, which in some cases can cost less them than a packet of cigarettes.
 
 Unfortunately, the pandemic has made so many more people across the globe even more desperate. Shockingly, even before the virus, there was anecdotal evidence that in some developing countries mothers had babies for this purpose: to sell their children’s innocence and bodies.
 
 This is National Child Protection Week. The Australian Federal Police works with agencies in Australia and overseas to keep kids safe — and to bring to justice those who harm our most vulnerable.
 
 Our message to predators is this: just because victims are outside Australia, it does not mean offenders are safe from the reach of law enforcement. We have the power to arrest and charge offenders who sexually abuse children offshore. The AFP works with our international partners to protect children from debased Australians wherever they may be in the world.
 
 Last March, a Victorian man working as an international flight attendant was sentenced to almost 19 years’ jail in Australia for sexually abusing children in The Philippines across seven years. He was charged with 35 serious child sex and exploitation offences.
 
 The AFP Victorian Joint Anti-Child Exploitation Team identified 26 female child victims aged between 12 and 17. The AFP international network engaged with the Philippine National Police to help rescue them.
 
 Next week a Cairns man is due back in Cairns Magistrates Court after being charged with possessing child abuse material. An AFP investigation began in July after officers received intelligence the man was allegedly sending remittances to The Philippines that could be facilitating the abuse of children. During the search of his home, police seized several electronic items that allegedly contained evidence of child abuse.
 
 Recognising the live, online child sexual abuse in The Philippines the AFP, along with our partners, established the Philippine Internet Crimes Against Children Centre, which tracks down the facilitators of the sexual abuse and removes children from harm.
 
 Since the inception of the PICACC, 21 suspects has been charged and 62 children have been rescued because of referrals via Australian-based investigations.
 
 The value of the AFP’s relationship with the Philippine National Police cannot be understated.
 
 Australians should be outraged by this offending, not only because it is abhorrent but also because recent investigations have revealed that pedophiles who view online child sex abuse material have also been contact offenders — and they are contact offending against children offshore and in Australia.
 
 Parents may find this subject almost unspeakable, but they must listen. We are urging parents to better understand technology, to be aware of the apps their children are using and to know whom their children are talking to online.
 
 Between July 1 last year and June 30 this year, the AFP laid 1214 charges against 161 people, removing 67 Australian children from harm.
 
 In the same period, the AFP-led Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation received more than 21,000 reports of child sexual exploitation, a 50 per cent increase on the year before. In April, May and June this year, reports to the ACCCE from the public relating to child exploitation material online increased 122 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. It is clear COVID-19 has drawn out more predators online.
 
 The average number of images seized when an offender is arrested has shot up. In the early to mid-2000s, offenders averaged about 1000 images; these days it is 10,000 to 80,000 images and videos.
 
 New material is being produced and shared every day. It is important to understand that a perpetrator on the other side of the world can use technology to target your child in your home.
 
 It is a distressing topic, but as a country — and in our own households — we need to talk about the threats to our children. We need to talk more about how to keep our kids safe online and in the community.
 
 If it takes a village to raise a child, advances in technology mean it now takes a country to keep them safe. For more information on how to keep children safe online and in the community, visit www.accce.gov.au[http://www.accce.gov.au] and www.thinkuknow.org.au[http://www.thinkuknow.org.au].

224,PAYING UP WILL PAY OFF,News,2020-11-11T04:23:04.329Z,"Most of us would do any job, but only if we’re paid the market rate As we enter a period of high unemployment, the costs of joblessness will be more apparent. In dealing with this social problem, something that may be useful to address is a misplaced condescension among Australian elites about certain job categories, which contributes to labour market problems for ordinary Australians.
 
 “Australians just won’t do those sorts of jobs” is a common claim elites use to advocate government schemes to import labour. But that is not right. It’s not that we consider some occupations below us, but that some employers — government and business — prefer to pay below the market rate required to secure a labour supply.
 
 Any vacancy, no matter how difficult or challenging, will be filled as long as it pays the market rate. Indeed, that is the very definition of the market rate: the wage offer that secures labour supply. Our history proves this economic truism: tough and exacting jobs have been taken on by Australians across the continent wherever market rates have been offered.
 
 The “Australians just won’t do those sorts of jobs” meme has gained currency among the tertiary-educated. Over two decades, policymakers have increasingly moved to the view that employers shouldn’t have to offer market rates to secure blue-collar workers, and have come to believe government should intervene with imported labour schemes.
 
 Without a requirement to offer market rates for labour, many employers have deemed there to be “shortages” that require the importation of lower-cost workers. The scope for deeming further “shortages” under this definition remains enormous, meaning downward pressure on wages could have decades to run.
 
 The ultimate destination, with high labour mobility, is convergence with low-wage countries. It’s worth noting that the levels of awards during this process, which some describe as a floor, would themselves adjust downwards in value over time in reflecting declining averages.
 
 For most of our history, Australia has not had imported labour schemes, and this absence has been a key part of how we became a First World country in stark contrast to a region of low wages. Rather than merging wages and living standards with large poor countries through labour mobility, Australia evolved as a distinct high-income country with broad wealth distribution contributing to political stability.
 
 In more recent times the advent of guest worker schemes has seen a steady undercutting of that high-wage status. The economic principle that drives guest worker schemes — arbitraging down the wage differences between wealthy countries and poorer countries — is playing out on the ground.
 
 Government import schemes have been very popular with some employers. Prior to the crisis, there were almost 900,000 people in Australia on a temporary visa with a work right, a figure that doesn’t include New Zealanders. Of course, the pandemic has reduced numbers, but as the crisis recedes there remain strong incentives for employers to import cheap labour.
 
 As we move into a period of high unemployment, the argument that we should return to importing high levels of cheap labour becomes weaker. The claim we have labour shortages is even more difficult to sustain when Treasury estimates a pool of ­unemployed people rising to about 8 per cent of the population. There is a role for importing ­labour in some areas, but in the broad it’s worth considering relying more on market forces to secure labour.
 
 Apart from the problems identified above, policymakers need to attend to related issues. Our industrial relations system should not be pricing people out of work. The welfare system should not be undermining work incentives. It should be easier for businesses to employ people and not fear being locked into poor outcomes. Getting policy settings right will be hard, but let’s make a start by ­retiring the assumption that there are jobs Australians just won’t do.

226,PERHAPS OUR AGED-CARE SYSTEM IS NOT IN SO MUCH CRISIS,News,2021-01-11T20:50:33.752Z,"Management and staff have risen to the task of protecting our most vulnerable The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety is in hibernation until COVID-19 passes. When the commissioners return, they might ask why a supposedly broken aged-care system performed so well in the crisis.
 
 When Spanish soldiers were deployed to disinfect nursing homes three weeks ago they found residents who had been left to die in their beds.
 
 In France, infected aged-care residents were imprisoned in their rooms for more than six weeks, unable to be transferred to hospital and barred from receiving visits from family.
 
 Their deaths went unrecorded in the official COVID-19 death toll at first. Now the authorities admit that more than a third of the country’s 980 deaths from the virus were in nursing homes.
 
 Nursing homes have become COVID-19 incubators across Europe. Italy’s death toll in nursing homes stood at 3859 on Sunday.
 
 In Sweden, the poster child for the welfare state, 94 of Sweden’s 290 local municipalities have reported confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases in elderly-care homes. More than half the 345 deaths in Canada occurred in long-term aged-care homes. In one facility in Bobcaygeon, Ontario, 27 of 65 residents died.
 
 In the US, a Wall Street Journal investigation has identified more than 2300 deaths in nursing homes. An official inquiry has been launched into a particular case in Massachusetts where 32 residents died at a government-run home for veterans.
 
 And Australia? A country in which the aged-care industry is “in crisis”, according to our national broadcaster. Where the host of its flagship investigative documentary series declared government regulation to be “an abject failure”.
 
 On Sunday there were 12 active cases of COVID-19 from Australia’s 2672 residential aged-care homes in Australia, all but one of them in NSW. Sadly, nine elderly residents have died, six of them from the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Sydney.
 
 When the history is written of Australia’s victory over coronavirus, the early decision to lock down aged-care homes and the dedication of management and staff in protecting those in their charge will provide a template for the rest of the world.
 
 It should serve as a template for the protection of all our elderly, particularly those in poor health.
 
 Unlike most other countries, the elderly are safer inside an Australian aged-care home than out. They are four times less likely to catch the virus than those over 70 in the community.
 
 Until a vaccine is found for COVID-19, there is a caveat attached to every good-news story. It takes only one person to carry the virus into an aged-care home to light a virological bushfire.
 
 Approximately six out of 10 aged-care residents are over 85. Not unexpectedly, they tend to be more frail than their contemporaries outside.
 
 Public health authorities in Australia are now exceptionally well equipped to deal with any outbreak. The outbreak at Dorothy Henderson Lodge began in late February when there were fewer than 10 confirmed cases of infection in NSW and Australians were preoccupied with bushfires.
 
 The response from NSW Health to the outbreak at the lodge was swift and followed a well-planned, rehearsed drill. Unlike Italy or Spain, there were hospital beds available.
 
 The tone of some of the ABC’s reporting of this outbreak suggests they were looking for confirmation of their conclusions. It was largely the ABC’s reporting of the “crisis” in Australian aged care that prompted the royal commission. The critical findings in the commission’s interim report were hardly surprising — even the best-run institutions can sometimes fall short of the required standards of care.
 
 Yet even before its adjournment, the commission was struggling to find examples of systemic failure. Failures in the system were once the only thing royal commissions were there to establish.
 
 Today, however, they are more often forums for multiple individual complaints that occasionally lead to prosecutions, but more often fail to meet the threshold required for criminal conviction.
 
 On the evidence so far, the aged-care system has stood up well to the test of a virus that is especially cruel to its clients. Infection control measures commonly imposed during flu seasons were activated at many facilities long before the federal government issued tougher guidelines a week ago.
 
 Many nursing homes have taken additional measures, according to those in the industry. Some aged-care workers are effectively self-isolating between shifts. Most are restricting contact with anyone outside work except immediate family.
 
 The frontlines of aged care and healthcare are where the battle is being won, not on our parks and beaches where the police are moving people on. If you can stop a person over 70 catching the disease, you are 20 times more likely to save a life than if you keep someone in their 20s or 30s virus-free.
 
 Good news is not hard to find these days as we contemplate the achievements of the past four weeks. When infection rates were doubling every two to three days late last month, our chance of avoiding the Italian route was by no means certain. Closing our borders, social distancing, testing and tracing have worked wonders.
 
 Of the 32 countries with more than 5000 identified cases, Australia has the second-lowest case fatality rate. The lowest is the Russian Federation, whose figures cannot be trusted.
 
 The federal government is tripling the number of ventilated acute care beds to 12000. On Sunday 1 per cent of them were occupied by COVID-19 patients.
 
 The risk of a second wave cautions against complacency. We must live with this virus until a medical solution is found, which could be 18 months.
 
 It’s all the more reason to redouble our efforts to protect those most at risk of serious illness or death while allowing the rest of the country to go about its business as cautiously as we can.Nick Cater is executive director of the Menzies Research Centre.",1023
227,POLITICS HAS DROWNED OUT THE DEATH OF A BLACK MAN,News,2021-07-16T10:30:17.052Z,"Chance for a new start? No, racial politics will be business as usual
 
 Politics, not principles, have drowned out the tragic death of a black man. Is the despicable killing of ­George Floyd a new start for race relations around the world? Sadly, no. The past fortnight of protests and riots in the US, and many other countries since, has become a showcase of politics as usual.
 
 There is nothing remotely new or refreshing about people siding with their tribe, rather than thinking for themselves and then calling out what’s wrong.
 
 But, then, political movements that become blunt instruments don’t allow for free thinkers.
 
 The modus operandi of the Black Lives Matter movement is simple: come up with a phrase that is self-­evidently true. Black Lives Matter. Yes, they do. The death of Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police was an abomination. Then attach a political movement to that self-evident truth. If you question any part of the political movement, you risk being denounced as someone who thinks that black lives don’t matter.
 
 In this case, if you condemn the venomous anti-Trump part of the protests, you are cast adrift. But facts matter too. The US President is not responsible for three centuries of racism in America. This scourge predates and will outlast his presidency.
 
 As the former opinion editor of The New York Times, James Bennet, discovered last weekend, if you run a piece by an elected representative that notes on dozens of occasions other presidents have ordered regular military units to quell violence — Franklin Roosevelt in 1943, Dwight Eisen­hower in 1957, John Kennedy in the early 1960s and Lyndon Johnson later that decade, and more recently George HW Bush during the 1992 Los Angeles race riots — a baying mob will demand your ­resignation. If you condemn the violence, the looting and wanton destruction of businesses run by people who can ill afford more devastation, you will be accused of being a moral relativist because there is less room to add shades of grey with facts to the black-versus-white canvas of modern politics.
 
 The culture wars are more highly charged today. An increasingly secular age has turned politics into the new religion, with its own version of moral commandments. The rise of identity politics has narrowed and deepened tribal allegiances even more. Dissent certainly, but also mere curiosity is apostasy.
 
 Pick a side holus-bolus or end up as a political orphan, marked down as suspicious and a moral equivocator. It’s not surprising that many people choose sides because the path of least ­resistance is much easier than confronting the nuance of complex problems. But beware where it leads.
 
 As Russian scholar Gary Saul Morson told The Wall Street Journal last weekend: “When you’re dragged along into something you don’t really believe yourself — because otherwise you are identified with those evil people, and your primary identity is being a ‘good guy’, not like those people — you will wind up supporting things you know to be wrong. And unless there is some moral force that will stop it, the slide will accelerate.” One of the many chilling scenes from the protests in the US has been the sight of white people kneeling in front of black people, seeking forgiveness and redemption for things they have not done and trying to renounce their white privilege. How will that help eradicate racism? This cult-like phenomenon points to a political movement that risks losing sight of principles; one that seeks submission from white people rather than equality for all.
 
 Those who are kneeling in front of black people or posting black squares on social media or tearing down statues or flying Black Lives Matters banners may genuinely feel helpless in the face of monumentally difficult issues. But they should not mistake an exercise in gesture politics with ­renouncing their privilege.
 
 Privilege is innate. It comes from being born into a loving ­family, from getting a good education, from the economic upsides that flow from one or both, and from never having to consider the colour of your skin. Privilege can be harnessed. But feeling good by kneeling in front of a camera, or posting on social media, is not the same as doing good far away from the crowds.
 
 The other chilling scene was US President Donald Trump holding up a Bible in front of the boarded-up St John’s Episcopal Church across the street from the White House last week. Trump did not open the Bible, or explain his own faith, or offer words of prayer for the cameras gathered around him after protesters were pushed back by police officers using tear gas, flash grenades and rubber bullets. Trump’s gesture politics, and his abuse of religion at a time of national crisis, ought to be called out, especially by Christians, on whose support the President depends.
 
 But once again tribal politics explains much of the silence. It is not very different to the failure of many progressives to denounce the gesture politics among Black Lives Matter protesters.
 
 Morson, a professor of Russian literature, points to the perils of the ideological segregation in the culture wars of today. “You get into a revolutionary situation because people can’t hear,” he told The Wall Street Journal.
 
 “Can there be a dialogue on important questions, or is there only one thing to say about every question? Are people afraid to say, ‘Well, yes, but it’s not quite as simple as that’? … When you can’t do that, you’re heading to a one-party state or a dictatorship of some sort. If one party is always wrong and another always right, why not just have the right one?” One can support the protests in the US, Australia and elsewhere and also question the misguided politics of the Black Lives Matter movement. One can support the protesters’ right to speak out and also ask how many of them gave a toss about the clampdown on civil liberties over the past few months. And how many of them have defended the right of others to speak out when they disagreed with what was being said?
 
 Writing in The Australian Financial Review last week, Aaron Patrick said it was “ironic” that many conservatives supported Drew Pavlou, a left-wing University of Queensland student who, if his claims are true, has been suspend­ed for his anti-China ­protests.
 
 It is not ironic at all. The deal with free speech is you defend those with whom you disagree, and they defend your right to speak freely too.
 
 On that front, it’s worth noting Pavlou hasn’t been a consistent supporter of free speech. In social media posts, he has called for the crushing of dissent and the bullying into submission of people with whom he disagrees. In those circumstances, moralising about your own right to protest may be marked down as a political stunt, not praised as a principled stand. Then again hypocrisy abounds. The NSW Court of Appeal gave the green light on Saturday for tens of thousands of people to gather on the streets when 50 people is the limit in a pub because, the court said in reasons delivered yesterday, police signalled to organisers it could go ahead. What a farce. It cannot be the case that civil liberties attach to only some people, to certain protests, to specific causes. That’s the road to authori­tarianism.",1262

He also said his group of followers needed to kill at least 1000 non-believers to make the Australian government withdraw troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
 Victorian Supreme Court justice Bernard Bongiorno sentencing Benbrika and his gang on February 3, 2009: The term jihad is used, particularly by Benbrika, in many of the intercepted conversations. Although it is an Arabic word which translates literally as struggle, it has acquired many different meanings in Islam, as Samir Mohtadi explained in his evidence. Many of those meanings are benign.
 
 And some are not so benign. Bongiorno continues: However, it also means a violent struggle against the enemies of Islam: the kuffar. This was the meaning which Benbrika attributed to it, and he claimed that it was the only meaning of jihad authorised by the Koran.
 
 Benbrika during his trial explained his position. Supreme Court of Victoria transcript, 2009: I don’t believe in this country. I don’t believe in this law. Which all this believe, no Allah but Allah, no Allah no other law of.
 
 Out to kill. Melbourne newspaper the Herald Sun, November 21, 2011: (Benbrika’s) team was settled on just one thing: as many Australians, men, women, children — it didn’t matter — should die for the greatness of their god as they could muster. It was quantity of murder they sought, not quality. If some Muslims were inadvertently caught up in their firestorm, well, they might have to divvy up the post-mortem virgins between them.
 
 Herald Sun, November 11, 2011: For too long we’ve been kind to criminal migrants. It’s time to revoke their citizenship and return them to their miserable lands, starting with Abdul Benbrika … Should we worry about Benbrika’s seven children? No. Should we worry about his naturalised Australian wife? No. Let’s just worry about us.
 
  Peter Dutton was listening. ABC, Wednesday: The federal government has cancelled the citizenship of Abdul Nacer Benbrika, one of Australia’s most notorious terrorists, ahead of his expected release from a Victorian prison. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton confirmed the government had now revoked Benbrika’s Australian citizenship. “I cancelled the Australian citizenship of convicted terrorist Benbrika, (making him) the first individual to have lost citizenship onshore,” he said.
 
 And he received special treatment. The Australian, Wednesday: The government amended the citizenship cessation bill on September 3 to apply to Australian citizens convicted of terrorism acts from May 2003. The act previously applied to acts committed after December 2015.",552
229,Prison is rarely just about the time served,Others,2021-08-17T23:32:45.400Z,"COMMENT
 
 Since 2015, Australia's crime rate has dropped by 3 per cent, while incarceration rates have increased by more than 16 per cent. However, not all crimes have decreased, with significant increases in drug offences, sex offences and domestic assaults.
 
 Dr Rick Brown, the deputy director of the Australian Institute of Criminology, has stated that the drop in the overall crime rate is not because we are incarcerating more people.
 
 This is a highly complex issue involving problems of systemic disadvantage encompassing education, services accessibility, experiences of addiction and violence, residential location, family attachment, mental health and unemployment.
 
 It cannot be simply understood as ""tough on crime = lowered crime rate."" In fact, the data demonstrates that locking people up increases the chances of an individual re-offending: the political spin simply does not hold up.
 
 At first glance, the unveiling of the Dillwynia Correctional Centre in NSW last month could be understood as cause for celebration. According to the Berejiklian government, this newly expanded medium security women's prison has been designed from a ""trauma-informed"" perspective, with a focus on preparing women for successful re-integration into the community.
 
 Corrections Minister Anthony Roberts stated that this approach is characterised by education programs and work opportunities within Correction Services Industries while the women are serving their time, and simultaneously working towards creating ""self-sufficient prisons.""
 
 Take a closer look though and it becomes clear that Dillwynia Correctional Centre is yet another example of the justice system entrenching the disadvantage of the women who come into contact with it.
 
 The NSW government is correct that trauma is a significant part of why most women are ending up in the justice system.
 
 But the government's response to these systemic issues is to focus on the individual and then seek to ""fix"" them, while exploiting them through programs that force free or extremely underpaid inmate labour.
 
 In essence, this absolves the government from the responsibility of creating and perpetuating the system that is causing the problems in the first place - or at least, gives them the means to convince the voters of their absolution.
 
 But can we hold the individual wholly accountable for the problems with the social/economic systemic structures that hold them back on the outside?
 
 Employment might be the route out of disadvantage for many people. But when you consider the functional illiteracy rate in prisons is about 80 per cent - and the level of disadvantage they face - an individual's ability to perceive of opportunities, identify the journey to take, and access the resources they need to navigate the process are deeply affected by these broader systemic issues.
 
 By only providing work-based programs behind the prison walls without addressing the systemic issues they will face again on the outside, they are glossing over the biggest problems that people in this situation encounter.
 
 They are so far behind the starting line that others seeking employment and social inclusion are lined up on, that it can often seem easier to return to activities that will land them back in prison.
 
 The government seems to find it acceptable to presume that, for many of these women, prison may be their only chance to achieve a consistent roof over their head, food in their bellies and access to proper healthcare.
 
 Furthermore, working for 30 hours a week for CSI, on a maximum ""wage"" of $2.43/hour, is not empowering, nor does it encourage skill growth, or enhance self-perceptions.
 
 When their labour is not valued, is often menial and offers no proper protections or even minimum wage, this system might be preparing them well for surviving JobActive and work for the dole programs, but it's not equipping them with a means of attaining - or believing themselves worthy of - meaningful work post-release.
 
 Criminal records shadow individuals who have been in prison, for 10 years, giving potential hirers cause for pause, landlords a reason to refuse decent housing, or affecting an ex-offender's ability to find a job, or even volunteer at their child's school.
 
 In Victoria, a person's criminal record burdens them forever.
 
 There's no work readiness program or low-level education course that can overcome that on its own.
 
 It's farcical that our government pretends that putting people in prison is good for their future job status. Incarceration is rarely just about the time served.
 
 For many, it is a life sentence within the context of a country that ""first creates thieves and then punishes them"" (Thomas More).

230,Public housing tenants must be heeded,Fairfax,2020-07-16T01:08:38.596Z,"I am the son of migrants and grew up in inner-city public housing in Melbourne in the 1970s and '80s. Having access to affordable housing helped level the playing field. Despite challenges and prejudices, it gave me the chance to achieve based on merit and hard work.
 
 This week, as public housing towers were placed under strict lockdown, I have had numerous conversations with residents, who as well as voicing frustration and concerns around immediate access to food and medication, and provision of healthcare workers, social workers and mental health support, have also highlighted concerns over access to resources and engagement with authorities.
 
 This crisis has shone a light on declines in public housing and opened up a chance for us to have a much-needed conversation about the nature of such housing and the long-term commitment needed to maintain this critical resource that has helped me and many others rise out of disadvantage.
 
 There has been a decline in funding for public housing by all levels of government of all political persuasions. The last time public housing rose as a percentage of total housing stock was in the 1980s and
 
 '90s under the Hawke/Keating governments. Since the high point of 5.6 per cent in 1991, it has fallen - yet the need has only grown.
 
 The last time significant federal money went towards public housing was during the GFC, when $5.2 billion was spent on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Not only has public housing stock gone down, but residents' agency and input have often been afterthoughts.
 
 This hard lockdown of high-density towers in Melbourne's inner north has suddenly rendered the invisible visible. I am encouraged that residents and community leaders finally have their voices being listened to, with so many eloquently explaining not only the needs of their communities, but putting forward ideas for how to better engage with government and shedding light on what public housing communities have already done to guard against the virus.
 
 They have been speaking on these issues for months, but this hard lockdown has suddenly put their viewpoints in the spotlight. They are not victims and they are not helpless - so many work hard to put food on the table, get a good education and build a better life. They have agency as individuals and as members of their community and they have a voice that should be heard.
 
 While the outpouring of support is welcome, it is underlying issues of resourcing and appropriate, effective engagement that we as MPs, and as policymakers, must continue to keep in the spotlight.
 
 There is a need for more federal and state funding for public housing, a need for all levels of government to engage with communities and treat people with respect, a need to listen to issues and incorporate them into policymaking. Public housing should not make people eternally dependent, but level the playing field.
 
 I support the need for strong measures by the state government to ring-fence the virus. All governments have done their best, and relative to other parts of the world, a terrific job in tackling the virus and keeping us safe. But this does not preclude us from asking questions with respect to how governments engage with public housing residents. We can all do better. Residents deserve to know what, if any, government plans were made to safeguard them during the pandemic?
 
 What other responses could have been pursued by governments to mitigate the pandemic risks in high-density public housing? Why weren't community leaders consulted and asked to help channel health information? What communications and health policies can be put in place for other public housing estates to prevent the extreme measure of hard lockdowns?
 
 Over recent days, I have heard this desire to be listened to and communicated with appropriately repeated time and again. We all must continue to play our role by following the health advice, but we are only all in this together if the voices of all Victorians are heard.

231,RACE PANIC GOES TO NEXT LEVEL,News,2020-08-06T18:03:38.131Z,"THIS hysteria must stop. Bubba Wallace is a perfect example of how even sane people now see racism where zero exists.
 
 Wallace is a black driver in a supposedly redneck sport — America’s National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. With Black Lives Matter protests at shrieking level, he demanded NASCAR ban the Confederate flag from its events, and won.
 
 But last week one of his team inspected the garage stall assigned to Wallace for Sunday’s race at Talladega. And shock! A noose! A lynching noose!
 
 Wallace immediately attacked this “despicable act of racism and hatred”, saying it “serves as a painful reminder of how much further we have to go as a society”.
 
 And cue the whole bend-the-knee race ritual that’s now required. The media denounced it and NASCAR declared it was “angry and outraged” by this “heinous act”.
 
 Every driver and crew member in Sunday’s race then walked in solidarity behind Wallace’s car (below) and pushed it to pole position, and the FBI sent 15 agents to investigate this rope.
 
 By then, amateur sleuths on the internet were already pointing out obvious improbabilities. How did this noose get into a protected garage with security cameras?
 
 And look: the pull-rope to Wallace’s garage was much shorter than the impractically long rope — with a loop handle — on the garage next door. It had been cut short.
 
 Sure enough, the FBI took five minutes to conclude the “noose” had been lying in that garage since last year, long before that garage was last week assigned to Wallace. No offence had been committed.
 
 Far from showing “how much further we have to go”, this farce showed how far we’ve overshot. There had been no racism, just an absurd overreaction likely to spread cynicism, not harmony.
 
 But think the race hustlers will miss a beat? Of course not! This is a game with no end.
 
 So now the ABC asks if it’s racist for chess games to start with a white piece moved first.
 
 Influential American race baiter Shaun King, who claims — on zero evidence — to be black, calls for statues and paintings of a white Christ to be destroyed.
 
  Nestle changes the “offensive” name of its Red Skins lollies. Are these people really fighting racism? Or are they like Bubba Wallace, turning even a door pull into a hanging offence?",407
232,"Raise wages, help recovery",Fairfax,2020-04-20T20:36:41.564Z,"A healthy economy for this country needs healthy growth in wages.
 
 In his genial and occasionally subversive manner, finance journalist Alan Kohler recently shared a graph on social media that compared two periods of sharemarket gains. The graph showed that in the 30 years to 1988, 92 per cent of gains were derived from economic growth. But in the decades since then, most sharemarket growth was produced by a ""transfer from wages"". In simple terms, businesses have been making money by taking more of the economic pie from their workers rather than growing it.
 
 The coronavirus pandemic has, if anything, exacerbated the trend with company profits rising while workers' total share of income has continued its steep decline.
 
 The suppressing of wage growth in Australia began 40 years ago at a unique time in our history. In 1982, for example, wages for full-time employees grew by 14.2 per cent. Inflation and unemployment also spiralled into double figures. Attempts to moderate wage growth and inflation failed until the election of the Hawke government in 1983. The new government recognised that the key to suppressing wage growth was reducing employee bargaining power by changing workplace laws and obtaining the agreement of the unions to reduce wage demands. The Accord and new workplace laws enshrining enterprise bargaining were born.
 
 In the decades since, waves of ""IR reform"" have continued along the same trajectory; allowing businesses to escape bargaining with their employees and weakening unions. In most private sector workplaces, bargaining has been eliminated and replaced by managerial decree, usually in the form of a take-it-or-leave-it employment contract. The imbalance in power is now so entrenched that wages have stagnated for the past eight years and the RBA forecasts more wage stagnation ahead.
 
 Union membership has collapsed under the weight of some of the most repressive laws in the OECD. The repression means that unions are raided by police searching for the minutes of their meetings and union officials are prosecuted for having a cup of tea. Australia is the only country in the world in which unions are forced by law to give away the services that they provide, in the form of better wages and conditions, to employees who don't belong to them. The laws that have diminished the unions brazenly violate international legal standards. The International Labour Organisation has repeatedly found that Australia's anti-union laws breach its international legal obligations and has requested the federal government amend them but those requests have been ignored.
 
 Generating shareholder dividends by labour cost-cutting has developed into a key business strategy. When I studied Global Business Economics at Melbourne Business School with a cast of budding CEOs several years ago, it was called ""labour arbitrage"". The relatively easy money garnered by this form of redistribution from the pockets of workers helps explain why companies have stopped investing in capital as well as research and development.
 
 The transition from full-time secure employment is accelerating. Employers continue to ""fissure"" their workforce; a process whereby direct employees are sacked and replaced with workers indirectly sourced through labour hire companies.
 
  Qantas has recently outsourced its ground handling workers to third-party providers. More than 2000 secure jobs are to be replaced by splintering the workers into smaller, precarious structures. Qantas will no longer need to bargain with the workers who perform ground handling work. Instead it can unilaterally set the price for their labour with the intermediaries that employ them.
 
 Similar patterns are evident in the UK and US. Former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane has observed that profound changes in workplaces have produced an era of ""divide and conquer"" that left workers less able to bargain for higher wages. In December, Christian Porter unveiled the federal government's new vision for workplaces. More wage suppression. The IR omnibus bill seeks to: eliminate billions in back-pay owed to employees falsely classed as casual employees; allow non-union agreements that make workers worse off; encourage eight-year agreements on new projects without the need for employee approval and cut part-time workers' overtime pay.
 
 The core of the neoliberal project - the transfer of wealth from workers in favour of business - has become an addiction. Regardless of the economic conditions - economic growth, boom or recession - the answer is wage suppression. Former finance minister Mathias Cormann is virtually the only politician to publicly admit that downward pressure on wages is a ""deliberate design feature"" of Morrison government policy.
 
 But companies supporting more wage suppression are at risk of cannibalising their businesses. Wage cuts and suppression can't continue indefinitely. Before the pandemic, wage stagnation had curtailed spending for goods and services, slowing economic growth to a crawl. Immigration was the only reason Australia avoided a recession.
 
 Now, the fastest way out of the coronavirus recession is to stimulate spending. The federal government's massive stimulus effort has started the recovery but its impact will soon start to taper off. And when that occurs, it will look to consumers to take up the slack. The day cannot be too far off that the federal government and its big business supporters will be forced to acknowledge that a healthy economy needs healthy wage growth. Healthy wage growth will require a radically different approach to labour market reform.

233,Reconciliation at heart of issue,Fairfax,2021-09-18T03:13:23.436Z,"The furore over vandalised statues masks a set of deeper unresolved problems that need to be addressed.
 
 History's a funny thing. It gives the impression of being fixed, chiselled into monuments and memorials, but it really exists as a matter of storytelling. What ends up mattering most is who gets to tell what stories, and what value the rest of us choose to give them.
 
 That's why the string of vandalised statues of colonial figures we're seeing (with the occasional demand they be torn down) seems to elicit such a different official response than the physical destruction of ancient, sacred Indigenous sites by mining companies across the country does.
 
 The former is an expression of political resistance that is either lacerated or humoured, but ultimately dismissed. The latter is a repeated occurrence that occasionally evokes some hand-wringing but is almost always officially permitted.
 
 And yet, for those truly concerned with history, it's worth noting that only the Indigenous sites represent the true destruction of history and cannot be replaced. What's being defaced in the case of those statues is not history itself, but rather commemoration. That's quite a different thing.
 
 The statues or memorial plaques are not historical artefacts in themselves, and the protesters that want to remove them are not arguing for history to be forgotten or erased. They're complaining about the way history is told. Indeed they're asking for it to be more fully told, less airbrushed.
 
 This discrepancy reveals that Indigenous history and culture has no serious purchase on the national imagination, and no particularly grave place in the reckoning of government.
 
 When the ministers give permits to mining companies to destroy these sites, they're assessing whether the economic benefit outweighs the cost of lost heritage. But it's not Indigenous communities that determine that cost, and in some cases the law doesn't require them even to be consulted.
 
 That's a problem because lost heritage is something you feel in your bones. Remember the ritual public mourning that overcame the world when Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral caught fire? That registered with us as tragedy because we value that expression of history and culture instinctively.
 
 It's impossible to imagine us tolerating a mining company destroying something like that for money. But when it comes to our Indigenous history, we're so systematically separated from it that we lack those instincts. Many of these sites don't even have heritage listing. Their routine destruction can only be possible because on balance, we see that history not as invaluable, but as an obstacle to profit.
 
 That, I suspect, is partly what's driving these protests against colonial commemoration. That official celebration of explorers and governors, with no mention of the Indigenous people they killed or the slaves they drove, obscures not just the oppression of our First Nations, but the very notion of them as fully-formed peoples with history and culture.
 
 And you can't be very well connected to a culture you won't let yourself see. In that sense, I suspect this isn't really about statues at all, which are probably a sideshow. It's more about the idea that the commemoration of these figures is an extension of the colonial attitude itself, where Indigenous populations become unpeople: obstacles to enrichment, much like their culture before mining companies.
 
 The protesters' complaint, as far as I can grasp, isn't that the people these statues sanctify failed by today's standards. It's that the legacy of their world view lives on, that the standards of their day still persist in subtle ways. Whether Australians are inclined to accept that argument or not, the trouble for us as a country is that we seem to have no real way to engage with it.
 
 We might acknowledge the facts of Indigenous disadvantage and declare some targets for ""closing the gap"" which seem never to be met. But that approach might give the impression the problem is a technocratic one, to be solved by tinkering with policy settings. That rather sidesteps the point of the protests, which is to bring the whole colonial project into focus. That's exactly why it won't be seriously considered by people in power.
 
 As things stand it can't be, because its challenge is inevitably existential: the logical extension of saying Captain Cook should be torn down is to question the legitimacy of the nation itself. Not many countries respond well to that kind of thing, which is why these arguments so often produce a visceral response.
 
 What we perhaps euphemistically call ""settler societies"" demand nothing as fundamentally as the acquiescence of the people they dispossessed. Without it, the questions become too big to process.
 
 That means the more these questions are asked, the more stuck we seem to become. It's like we lack the political technology to come to a resolution.
 
 That impasse will only change when we feel less existentially threatened by the fundamental objections of our Indigenous communities. That means finding a way to incorporate the grievances of dispossession into the very idea of Australia, somehow reconciling the modern nation unto its ancient ones.
 
 That's the role a treaty might play, for instance, because - in theory at least - it would mean some basis for coexistence has been agreed, making honest conversations about history less existentially loaded.
 
 But more broadly, it's the national project of reconciliation, which strikes me as so important but which I hardly recall being discussed in the fury of this past fortnight.
 
 Perhaps that idea died when a previous version of our government took the Uluru Statement from the Heart and then blatantly misled the public about what it meant and dismissed it without even leading a national conversation on it.
 
 Perhaps that act of astonishing bad faith blew up the project of a reconciled Australia like so many sacred sites before and since.
 
 Perhaps our crowning failure is to recognise that reconciliation isn't some gift to give magnanimously to Indigenous people, but is rather something the nation as a whole needs for its own sake. And perhaps in its absence there is nothing left any more but protests, anger, and statues.

234,Single parents now at risk of serious hardship,Fairfax,2021-03-03T12:48:47.928Z,"Poverty shock is looming for single parents who lost their jobs during the pandemic when the government starts winding back its coronavirus payments this week. Single parents account for one in eight Australian families and they are more likely to be out of work in this recession.
 
 For those who have lost work during the coronavirus pandemic, free childcare and the Coronavirus Supplement initially cushioned the blow. But free childcare ended in July and the Coronavirus Supplement - an extra payment to recipients of unemployment benefits and pensions as part of the federal government's economic stimulus - is due to drop from $550 to $250 a fortnight from Friday.
 
 The single-parent pension, aka the Parenting Payment, is about $790 a fortnight without the supplement.
 
 A Gillard-era policy means single parents of children over the age of eight receive JobSeeker of $612 a fortnight rather than the pension. The Coronavirus Supplement is the same for both groups.
 
 I've crunched the numbers to try to see what the reduction from $550 to $250 will mean for families.
 
 For single parents who were on the full pension of $790 a fortnight before the pandemic, most will still be better off than pre-COVID-19. That's because to receive the full pension, employment income is capped at $192.60 a fortnight plus $24.60 for each additional child. You would need three children in order to earn $250 a fortnight and keep the full pension.
 
 But for single parents who combined a part-time job with a part pension before the pandemic and then lost work because of COVID-19, this could be the moment that plunges them into serious hardship.
 
  Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released in August show the unemployment rate for lone parents with children under the age of 15 was 10 per cent in July, compared with the national unemployment rate of 7.6 per cent. (The national unemployment figure for August, released last week, declined to 6.8 per cent but the latest figures for lone parents are yet to be published).
 
 The unemployment rate for lone parents is slightly higher than before the pandemic, while the workforce participation rate for this group declined from 68.5 per cent in February to 66.3 per cent in July. This indicates many single parents are not working but not actively looking for a job because of the tough job market or changed caring responsibilities.
 
 My analysis shows if a single parent of two children under the age of 8 lost a job with a gross salary of $1000 a fortnight, the loss of employment income was initially fully offset by increased benefits and free childcare.
 
 Without the job but with full Parenting Payment and the special pandemic provisions of Coronavirus Supplement and free childcare, the person's disposable income rose to $992 a fortnight.
 
 The model assumes one child in after-school care and one in long daycare for two days a week each and weekly rent of $500. It assumes they are not eligible for JobKeeper and do not receive child support.
 
 However, the return of the Child Care Subsidy and fees on July 12 meant a 30 per cent decline in disposable income to $691 a fortnight if they maintained childcare days. From Friday, the lower supplement will mean a further 35 per cent decline in disposable income to $448 a fortnight. Many parents would try to maintain childcare arrangements after losing a job to enable them to look for work and accept a job and for the proven benefits especially for children of preschool age.
 
 Most people don't set out to become single parents or unemployed during a pandemic, but if there's anything 2020 has taught us it's that life doesn't always work out the way you plan. The government reportedly has more economic stimulus in mind; investing in the next generation by ensuring more families don't fall into poverty would be a good place to start.

235,Slow and steady on post-virus cutbacks,Fairfax,2020-02-23T16:11:27.793Z,"The $200 billion in emergency assistance the Morrison government has announced over the past two weeks may shore up the economy through the coronavirus crisis. But the unprecedented stimulus package raises some hard questions about what happens after that.
 
 How should Australia repay eye-watering national debt? How soon can some of these programs be scaled back? And what pre-COVID-19 spending and revenue measures should be reconsidered? There are no easy answers.
 
 The Coalition, traditionally the party of free enterprise, launched the biggest ever expansion of the role of government in Australia's peacetime history. Its willingness to spend is to be commended. But who would have dreamed a month ago that Prime Minister Scott Morrison would switch to guaranteeing 80 per cent of wages and making childcare free?
 
 The government is right to pay attention to the long-term sustainability of our debt but its response must not be coloured by ideology. Cutting back spending too quickly risks the economy slumping into a deep recession.
 
 In a show of fiscal virtue, Mr Morrison on Thursday said he wanted a ""snap back"" in spending at some point. His choice of words is open to interpretation but a gradual winding down of emergency measures is the best approach.
 
 Economic support should be reduced steadily as the economy recovers, but only once the surge in unemployment starts to subside. Rather than slashing all emergency benefits, the government should make them incrementally less generous and heighten the bar.
 
 Mr Morrison yesterday hinted that over the next six months Australia could start relaxing some of the extreme social distancing measures.
 
 That is good news but economic recovery will take a long time. It could be a year or more before all of the restrictions are rescinded. Some industries such as international tourism and education might take years to recover properly.
 
 In all likelihood the budget will remain in deficit for years. Yet it is important to put Australia's situation in context and realise that Australia has financial room to move even now. Thanks to the tight budgeting of the past five years by the Coalition, debt was low compared to most countries before the crisis. For example, currently Australia's government net debt as a share of the economy is only about a quarter the size of government debt in the US.
 
 Thanks to this buffer, Australia is not in immediate danger of losing its AAA rating and our credit is still seen as one of the safest bets on global financial markets. Gradually winding back the temporary stimulus should be enough to reassure markets but Australia will have to make some fundamental decisions about whether to make any part of the enormous expansion in the welfare state over the past four weeks permanent.
 
 On the one hand, conservatives are right that excessive welfare can undermine economic flexibility and reduce the incentives to find work. But on the other hand, it will be politically difficult for Mr Morrison to cut back on things such as free childcare that are popular with aspirational voters.
 
 He could also struggle to reverse the rise in the Newstart allowance, which even some business groups have said was too low.
 
 Mr Morrison may also have to go against all his political instincts by raising taxes to help fill the gap in the budget.
 
 The federal government has barely had time to catch its breath in the past month and until the immediate pandemic crisis has eased, these debates are largely academic. Perhaps, however, by the time Treasurer Josh Frydenberg hands down his delayed budget in October he will be in a position to sketch out the broad brushstrokes of a plan for the years ahead.
 
 A gradual winding down of emergency measures is the best approach.",639
236,So JobKeeper stays. Then what?,Fairfax,2020-07-02T15:15:12.983Z,"Can Morrison and Frydenberg deliver what the party room wants as well as what the economy needs?
 
 A surprising silence fell over some Liberal offices this week when the Morrison government said it would spend another $20 billion on income support for workers and the unemployed.
 
 The phones were quiet. Some of Scott Morrison's backbenchers were struck by the lack of thunder about the latest boost to a massive stimulus.
 
 ""I haven't had a single phone call or email about it,"" says one Liberal MP in suburban Melbourne. A Liberal in Sydney says the same thing. A check of other party room members suggests the muted response was fairly widespread. It was as if the community gave a quick nod and moved on.
 
 Australians have more than the budget to worry about when the country had 388 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, 502 on Wednesday and 423 yesterday, showing the second wave of the pandemic has surged higher than the first.
 
 But the silence was unusual given MPs had received a flood of feedback, most of it positive, after the income support was announced in March. With 3.5 million people on the JobKeeper wage subsidy and another 1.6 million on the JobSeeker unemployment benefit, these payments count more than any other budget measure right now.
 
 Labor complains that $6 billion has been wasted on part-time workers, that casual workers have been left out of the scheme and that the jobless are still waiting for a permanent increase in unemployment benefits.
 
 But Liberals are confident of the quiet approval for the income support, even though the payment rates will fall. JobKeeper is now the government's biggest asset and could stay that way to the next election. It is a brand with more power than the slogans that took the Coalition to victory under Tony Abbott.
 
 With the health crisis getting worse, Australians should not be shocked at yesterday's confirmation that the deficit will reach $184.5 billion this year.
 
 The number reshapes Australian political debate after a decade of Liberal and National alarm about deficits and debt. The parties that attacked Labor for posting deficits in a crisis a decade ago, but could not post surpluses in better times themselves, now ask voters to accept the worst numbers since World War II. No government has been mugged by reality quite like this.
 
 What matters most is what comes next. Morrison and Frydenberg are yet to outline the measures that can breathe more life into the economy if, or when, the second wave passes.
 
 The $2 billion skills package offers a start, with plans for more than 340,000 training places, but it will not be enough when people move off JobKeeper and into unemployment - which is inevitable when employers admit the jobs no longer exist.
 
 The last time unemployment was so grim, the Keating government responded with the Working Nation plan across industry policy, skills and employment.
 
 The July Economic and Fiscal Update was hardly a plan of this scale. As Morrison said, it was more a reconciliation of the numbers. Those who want a bigger plan must wait for the October budget.
 
 There is no real dispute over the fact this week's plans are not enough. The Coalition party room admits this by calling for more intervention. Liberal MPs want to bring forward personal tax cuts, slow down or stop an increase in superannuation levies, and offer more help on business taxation.
 
 There is strong support for these changes inside the party room, even though they are all highly divisive in the wider world.
 
 Social service groups, for instance, argue the tax cuts would help those lucky enough to have a job at the very time those without work suffer a cut to their JobSeeker rates. The reply from Liberal MPs is that $164.1 billion is already being spent on emergency support and there is room for tax relief as well.
 
 Everything depends on what ""bring forward"" means. The tax cuts due to begin in July 2022 are estimated to cost $48 billion over a decade. Bringing them forward by one year would not break the bank - or, arguably, do much for the economy.
 
 The tax cuts due to begin in July 2024 are tipped to cost $95 billion over a decade. Someone on $200,000 a year would gain $11,640 a year. Bringing this forward would throw Morrison and Frydenberg into an argument they do not need over the fairness of helping the wealthy.
 
 Frydenberg says he will look at those issues in the budget. Could he bring forward the tax cuts for average workers while making the well-off wait? This could make it more palatable to the Senate.
 
 Changes to superannuation are more challenging. The increase in the levy from 9.5 to 12 per cent is a delayed version of a Labor reform from a decade ago. It is already legislated. To stop the increase is to deprive workers of a bigger retirement income - although how much higher is a subject of dispute.
 
 Employers pay the levy and would be the biggest winners from another delay. In theory, they could pay their workers higher wages if they did not pay the levy. In practice, workers would not trust the invisible hand to release the cash.
 
 This looks like a Senate battle not worth having.
 
 The fiscal update is merely a signpost on the path to these decisions. The pandemic is worsening but Australians must wait for a more comprehensive response in the budget in October.
 
 Can Morrison and Frydenberg deliver what the party room wants as well as what the economy needs? It will be a fine balance but they will know when they get it wrong. That's when the phones ring off the hook.

237,Social housing boost deserves praise,Fairfax,2021-10-02T08:33:29.226Z,"The Age's View
 
 Some years ago, an inmate at the Fulham prison near Sale was asked on community radio station 3CR what the one thing was he needed to turn his life around once he was free. ""A roof over your head,"" was his immediate answer. ""If you haven't got that and you're living house to house and you don't feel safe out there, of course you're going to come back.""
 
 Victorians from many different walks of life struggle with mental and physical health issues, domestic violence or an income that is too low for them to live near their place of work. For far too long, they have found that the absence of social housing and affordable housing has kept them ""coming back"", either to entrenched poverty brought on by housing that consumes the bulk of their income, or to severely stretched support services. For some, it can mean life on the streets or even jail.
 
 Our avowedly progressive state has the lowest proportion of social housing in the country - only 3.2 per cent of housing stock, compared with an already meagre national average of 4.2 per cent.
 
 At the same time, the number of Victorians who need social support to acquire a home has grown with our expanding population, rising rents and house prices, so that in September the number of households on the waiting list was 48,529 - more than 100,000 people.
 
 In this context, the Andrews government's decision to put an unprecedented $5.3 billion into building more than 12,000 homes within four years deserves the applause it has received from many quarters. Economists have advocated construction of social housing both as a fillip for the construction industry and a way of getting thousands of people back into productive lives as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes. The Victorian Council of Social Service welcomed the package as a ""game changer"" and the Property Council said it wanted the program to go ahead as soon as possible. Others hoped the move would encourage the federal government to come to the party.
 
 The Andrews government faces a number of challenges in making sure its commitment is implemented to best effect. One is the classic real estate issue of location, since housing will have to be close to services and jobs rather than in outer suburbs where land may be cheaper. This in turn raises the question of how such housing and its occupants will be integrated into neighbourhoods, which the government has to some extent pre-empted by announcing that it will handle and fast-track planning approvals rather than leaving them in the hands of councils.
 
 For many of those in need of social housing, a roof over their head is essential but means little without what is termed ""wrap-around support"" - attention to the individual's physical, mental and medical needs aimed at stabilising them in their new lives. Co-ordinating these elements will require a whole-of-government approach.
 
 It has already been indicated that much of the social housing being built will be community housing - run by not-for-profit agencies - and not public housing, which is owned and run by the state. The Renters & Housing Union points out that public housing is cheaper and more secure for tenants who often present particular challenges for any landlord.
 
 For the state to make itself that landlord might prove a daunting prospect for many politicians. But Daniel Andrews, Richard Wynne and Lily D'Ambrosio have already taken a very bold first stride that could lead to historic change for people so often overlooked when we consider this state's prosperity and liveability. We believe that in this they deserve the encouragement and support of every Victorian.",636
238,Spare me racism lectures from ABC,News,2020-12-20T19:35:45.007Z,"I DON’T want another lecture from the ABC about Australia’s racism. Turns out this taxpayer-funded finger-wagger has been the real racist all along. Hear it from Osman Faruqi, a former Greens candidate and deputy editor at the ABC, who complains that “white nationalism constantly features on the ABC”.
 
 Sure, you might not take seriously a man who himself tweets race-baiting stuff like: “It’s time for white people to take a back seat.” So how about Gen Fricker, who was a host at the ABC’s Triple J until last year, and says even this hip youth outlet was racist.
 
 She said it was “f … ing lonely … being one of two brown people in those rooms having to explain why maybe a white woman singing in another language with no black people was a bit f … ing problematic”.
 
 No, I didn’t quite get that, either, but Fricker, who has Maori ancestors, did have another beef: “Having to ask co-workers to stop doing African-American accents in the office.” That said, you might wonder about claims from a woman who insists she’s brown and others white when, for all we know, the other ABC staffers who look as pale as her might also actually be just as brown, too. So to speak.
 
 I mean, judging “race” by skin tone: isn’t that now racist?
 
 OK, then how about ABC journalist Tahlea Aualiitia, who has Samoan heritage and has written a diatribe headed: “My employer spelled my name wrong twice and why it matters.” Aualiitia links those misspellings to racism: “It’s no coincidence I’m speaking up about this during the latest wave of the Black Lives Matter movement. It’s hard to explain what racism feels like to someone who has never experienced it.” In which case ABC TV host David Speers is an even more tragic victim of racism. His name was misspelled no fewer than three times on Sunday — “Spears” — on the home page of his own Insiders show.
 
 Of course, some people will complain this evidence is as thin or trivial as most other complaints now of racism, and would be dismissed at most other workplaces.
 
 But that may be the ultimate proof. Only a race-obsessed organisation like the ABC could take such stuff seriously, and react to it with the usualgenuflections.
 
 More affirmative action hirings, perhaps?
 
 More race quotas? More “good” racism?",414
239,Staged return fails the test for HSC students,Fairfax,2021-03-16T05:41:15.330Z,"The elephant in the Australian classroom has long been the equity gap between schools: we have one of the widest gaps in the OECD. There has not been a level playing field for our young people for quite a while now.
 
 The current debate on the best way for students to return to full-time schooling as the coronavirus pandemic wanes highlights this inequity. Students in public schools, particularly HSC students, are likely to suffer significant disadvantage from the NSW government's toe-in-the-water, one-day-a-week staged return to school, while teachers have not had the reassurance that schools are safe places to work.
 
 Private and Catholic schools do not have to undertake a staged return. Individual schools and systems can decide how they will return to class. The government's plan for public schools has all students attending one day a week from May 11, gradually increasing until term 3 when everyone will be back full time.
 
 What does this mean for year 12 students in public schools? Well, year 12 starts on May 11 with face-to-face teaching one day a week for four weeks, increasing to two days for the remaining four weeks of term: a total of 12 possible face-to-face school days. That compares with about 40 days for private and Catholic school students.
 
 Of course, there is provision for online learning in the 28 days that students are not in class, but at this stage of the HSC face-to-face teaching and access to school facilities are critical. For instance, any outstanding mandatory science practicals will have to be squeezed into those 12 days with other lessons.
 
 The HSC curriculum is tight and students will need to cover a lot of ground that could not be covered online. Why can't this be done in term 3? That is when trial HSC and HSC practical exams are held and major works and school assessments are submitted to the NSW Education Standards Authority. It is students' final term before their exams. NESA has confirmed that HSC exams will go ahead as usual in term 4 and has extended the deadline for major works, but realistically there is not a lot of time to spare. Students with only 12 days at school in term 2 will not have the same preparation as private school students with 40 days at school.
 
 Those year 12 students complaining this is unfair are right - and it is even more unfair for disadvantaged students, for whom the daily interactions and support of teachers make all the difference.
 
 The NSW Teachers' Federation also has criticised the government's plan as unfair and wants it to prioritise year 12 in the return to school, as Catholic schools are doing. The Premier's sharp response - that teachers just want to continue online delivery indefinitely - was unhelpful and incensed teachers. They have delivered online learning within a remarkably short timeframe, while continuing face-to-face teaching for children remaining at school.
 
 Under the government's staged return, teachers will have to divide larger classes into smaller groups for social distancing and will have to repeat lessons. While teaching students face-to-face on one day a week, they will still need to keep up with online lesson preparation and marking and assessment for everyone until term 3. This represents a dramatic increase in teacher workload and is an unnecessary duplication of effort at a time when many teachers fear their health will be at risk when school goes back.
 
 While the evidence suggests students may not be significant spreaders of the virus, adults are - and teachers must work alongside fellow teachers and other adult staff. The government needs to ensure that schools are safe for the adults as well as the children. And it needs to give priority to year 12 students' immediate full-time return to ensure they have a sporting chance of completing the HSC on par with their private school peers.

241,Taxpayer-funded priests - should that really be allowed?,Others,2020-12-16T02:33:03.069Z,"Did you know that the federal government pays the wages of Catholic priests and other ministers of religion? And that the Catholic Church asks those priests to donate some of the money to the church? This is the latest controversy over the federal government's JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme.
 
 This is almost certainly unconstitutional - but that doesn't really bother the federal government.
 
 Priests and other religious practitioners were not eligible for JobKeeper payments when the taxpayer-funded wage subsidy first commenced at the outset of the coronavirus lockdowns.
 
 Treasurer Josh Frydenberg made a formal amendment to the JobKeeper rules in May to include religious practitioners within the eligibility rules. He also changed the rules to make sure universities would not be eligible for JobKeeper.
 
 The Nine papers recently revealed that a range of large religious denominations are the beneficiaries of this scheme. The ABC also revealed that the Parramatta Catholic diocese has been asking its priests to donate ""between $500 and $700 per fortnight"" of their JobKeeper payments to the church to ""assist with future payments and the balance sheet"".
 
 The Australian Taxation Office website explains that the federal government provides eligible religious institutions like the Catholic Church $1,500 a fortnight for each of their religious practitioners ""to perform religious activities"".
 
 That's an enormous amount of public money going to churches and other religious institutions to fund religious activities.
 
 The Treasurer's taxpayer-funded priests amendment is almost certainly unconstitutional. The High Court has been clear that the federal government cannot fund religious activities.
 
 In 1981, the High Court ruled that there was no constitutional problem with the federal government providing funding to Catholic schools. The argument in the so-called Defence of Government Schools or DOGS case relied on a section of the Australian Constitution that prohibits federal parliament making 'any law for establishing any religion'.
 
 The High Court ruled that although public money goes to religious institutions there is no constitutional problem because the money is designed to be used for educational purposes.
 
 The Treasurer's taxpayer-funded priests amendment is very different to funding for religious schools. It is designed to directly fund religious activities.
 
 The amendment itself says a religious practitioner is eligible for a JobKeeper wage subsidy if they are undertaking activities ""in pursuit of the individual's vocation as a religious practitioner"".
 
 If the matter ever got to court, the taxpayer-funded priests amendment would almost certainly be struck down as invalid.
 
 The JobKeeper taxpayer-funded priests amendment is not the only federal government funding of religious practitioners. There are at least two others.
 
 The federal government continues to fund the school chaplains program, which in practice requires people to be Christian to get youth worker jobs in public schools.
 
 The federal government also funds military chaplains, who can only come from a small number of government-approved faith groups - even though a majority of Australian Defence Force personnel are not religious at all. The military chaplains program was the subject of a 2018 religious discrimination complaint to the Australian Human Rights Commission by a Canberra humanist hospital chaplain who was denied the opportunity to apply for a military chaplain job because he is not religious.
 
 Things are slowly changing. In May, the navy announced that it would be introducing non-religious chaplains alongside its religious chaplains.
 
 The federal government gets away with spending public money in constitutionally dodgy ways because it knows that almost no one is game enough to challenge them in court. Court cases cost a lot of money and you have to pay the government's legal fees if you lose. And to start a challenge you need to convince the court that you have been directly affected. Almost everyone directly affected by constitutionally dodgy government funding is perfectly happy because they are either receiving the money or hoping to receive the money. They won't be challenging.
 
 Unless there's some kind of miracle, the constitutionally suspect funding of religious practitioners is likely to continue until the whole JobKeeper scheme comes to an end.

 The suspension, accreditation and licensing of the company – which employed the carer at the centre of the Annie Smith tragedy – rests with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission.
 
 Human Services Minister Michelle Lensink has made her views crystal clear in that she fully supports taking action against any care provider flouting the laws that protect people with disability from abuse and neglect.
 
 That said, the government could certainly do more to reassure the public the employees of any care provider are all fit and proper persons to be working with the vulnerable.
 
 The fact Integrity Care submitted 33 applications for its employees for such clearances to a state government department just days after the death of Ms Smith is alarming. It clearly points to a serious breakdown of practices and procedures within the company.
 
 It is also an apparent breach of the requirement for such companies to ensure employees have the required clearance as a prerequisite to obtaining NDIS funds.
 
 While South Australians know the clearance of suspect carer Rosemary Maione was revoked just days after being approved, the status of the remaining 32 Integrity Care workers clearances is unknown.
 
 The government has initiated an investigation into each but has declined to reveal the results, citing possible prejudice to inquiries into Ms Smith’s death.
 
 That excuse does not fly. Police have already said that Ms Maione was the only carer involved with Ms Smith.
 
 Revealing if any of the other 32 Integrity Care staff had been refused clearance or had it revoked would help appease public anger surrounding Ms Smith’s death.

 Two goals must be at the head of the investigation – uncovering exactly what went wrong and ensuring such horrific neglect and abandonment does not happen again.
 
 Ms Smith, 54, who had cerebral palsy, died last month from serious medical conditions. She was admitted to the Royal Adelaide Hospital on April 5 suffering from septic shock, severe pressure sores, multiple organ failure and malnutrition. Her death has been declared a major crime, with police investigating how she had been unable to move from a woven cane chair in her loungeroom for more than a year and had no access to a toilet or fridge containing food.
 
 Premier Steven Marshall yesterday said the taskforce, to be headed by South Australia’s Disability Advocate David Caudrey, would investigate any gaps in industry care. The state Coroner also will hold an inquest after the police investigation is completed.
 
 There will, it seems, be no shortage of investigations into this scandal. Already, though, a patchwork quilt of accountability and responsibility is emerging, creating dangerous potential for buck-passing and blame-shifting.
 
 The official taskforce must accurately establish the clear reporting chain for the private disability carer responsible for looking after Ms Smith.
 
 The investigation also must pinpoint the lines of responsibility within the provider, Edwardstown-based Integrity Care SA, and the federal and state bureaucracies involved.
 
 This sickening incident is, rightly, a political powder keg and the clear facts must be established, both to apportion blame and identify any systemic issues. This should include examining the responsibilities of state and federal governments.

 At least 4100 people have been arrested and curfews imposed in a bid to quell riots in major cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.
 
 The street protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis – after a police officer pressed his knee to Mr Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes on May 25 – have gone global as demonstrators gather in London, Berlin and Toronto.
 
 Thousands are expected to gather in Sydney’s Hyde Park tomorrow, and similar demonstrations in Australia.
 
 It is vital to remember that the dystopian scenes in the US are unfolding during a global pandemic that, tragically, has resulted in the deaths of more than 104,000 people in that country alone.
 
 Inarguably, the riots have been fomented by a rising sense of injustice among marginalised people in the US, particularly in minority communities which feel targeted by violence at the hands of police.
 
 Yet the pandemic shutdown and subsequent mass unemployment also must have contributed to lighting the spark that has become an inferno.
 
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday cautioned against importing the violence, rightly observing that US civil rights luminary Martin Luther King “didn’t change anything by burning anything down or by looting any shops”.

 Police launched a manslaughter investigation after it was revealed Ms Smith died of septic shock and multiple organ failure.
 
 She had spent most of the year leading up to her death living in putrid conditions in a woven cane chair in the loungeroom of her home. The cane chair and carpet underneath it was soaked in urine and faeces.

 This is another terrible twist in the appalling saga that has reignited intense public debate about disability care, funding, scrutiny and supervision.
 
 Yet the personal stories can sometimes be overlooked as these important issues of public interest are discussed in the community.
 
 Ms Smith’s situation was so disgracefully squalid and inhumane that it was extraordinary. But her circumstances were not. She lived with a disability, as many Australians do. Like them, she deserved respect, support and understanding.

 By contrast, the national rate rose only slightly from 7.1 per cent to 7.4 per cent.
 
 Premier Steven Marshall has consistently argued he wants SA to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic in a better position than any other part of the country.
 
 Leading the nation on unemployment is not a good place to be. But despite the title, there are some statistics that could give the Premier, and the state, some hope.
 
 About 11,400 jobs were created in SA in June, replacing all of those lost in May.
 
 However, 20,000 people started looking for work last month, driving up the state’s unemployment figure.
 
 There are now 817,300 people employed in SA, which is a big drop compared with 854,400 in March when the lockdowns started. The harsh reality remains that 37,100 jobs have been lost since the pandemic began.
 
 Mr Marshall’s handling of the health crisis has been universally lauded, albeit with the odd hiccup.
 
 But it will be the level and speed of South Australia’s economic recovery that will define Mr Marshall’s leadership.
 
 The true impact of the economic wrecking ball that has been COVID-19 will not be fully realised until September when the Federal Government’s JobKeeper program is expected to stop.

 “We would hope to reduce the number of people who develop PTSD but even for those people who do, it is a condition that can be treated,” he said.

 So action is needed.

250,The great Australian betrayal,Fairfax,2020-03-13T15:31:42.863Z,"Decades of policy failure have left too many Australians no hope of home ownership, writes Jessica Irvine.
 
 The year is 1985. Bob Hawke has just slid into the Lodge with a landslide victory in the 1984 election. On the radio, the British band Dire Straits dominates with its Brothers in Arms album and its hit song Money for Nothing extolling the benefits of being a lead guitarist: That ain't workin' that's the way you do it:/Money for nothin' and your chicks for free. The average Australian home price is somewhere between twice and three times the national average salary.
 
 Sure, interest rates are about to hit the roof and recession is on its way but, for now, at least, the pathway to home ownership for young Aussies (a cohort who will one day wear the disparaging epithet of ""OK Boomer"") is relatively clear.
 
 Fast-forward three decades. What seemed like an innocent enough and catchy radio tune has turned prophetic. Real wages have risen by about a half, but home values have tripled. It's Australia 2020, and that's the way you do it: money for nothing and it's capital gains tax free.
 
 Today, Australian home values are worth about seven times the average salary. In Melbourne, it's eight times. In Sydney, it's more than nine times. And that's before the latest resurgence in home values. It's the untold back story to Australia's recent economic success. Until now.
 
 This week, three of Australia's leading housing academics, Hal Pawson, Vivienne Milligan and Judith Yates, released a book, Housing Policy in Australia: a case for system reform, which pulls together decades of research into what they see as a systematic failure of Australian policy when it comes to that most basic of human rights: shelter.
 
 ""Housing system reform is overdue and increasingly urgent,"" they conclude.
 
 While global factors, such as ultra-low interest rates, have pushed up home values globally, the deterioration in affordability has been even more pronounced in Australia, the authors find. Indeed, Australia has seen the worst decline in home affordability, as measured by home values as a multiple of incomes, of any major OECD country since 1985, according to their analysis.
 
 Why? Far from being a symptom of our success, rising home values are a sign of super-sized policy failure at the national level, they say.
 
 While housing policies periodically get some time in the political sun - usually around elections - the last time Australia had a serious comprehensive national strategy to house its people was in the post-World War II era, when the federal government led the great push into the suburbs. Since then, reforms have been sporadic and often counterproductive.
 
 The authors point to the obviously harmful impact of the capital gains concessions on investment property, which has inflated demand for housing while encouraging property to be viewed as a speculative vehicle for wealth accumulation rather than a fundamental need.
 
 Meanwhile, rising home values have pushed more people into private rental accommodation, where tenant rights have not kept pace. Meanwhile, those on low incomes, squeezed out of private rentals, have encountered an overburdened and inadequate public housing system.
 
 We are now at a crunch point, the authors argue, where in addition to the obvious inequality of Australia's housing system, the manifest failure to ensure a path to home ownership will put increasing stress on the national budget as households that do not own their home require higher support payments in retirement to cover housing costs.
 
 So, what to do about it?
 
 ""There is no responsible 'business as usual' option,"" Hal Pawson told a Committee for Sydney event this week to launch the book. ""A national housing strategy is long overdue and can only be led by the Commonwealth. It must be national because ... it's plain that key instruments of housing policy, especially tax and social security settings, are controlled by the Commonwealth and not the states.""
 
 So what would a national housing strategy look like?
 
 First, it would be overseen by a dedicated housing minister at cabinet level. Federally, Michael Sukkar is the current Housing Minister, but he's not in cabinet and he juggles the role with the not insignificant responsibilities of being Assistant Treasurer.
 
 Second, we need a dedicated national agency responsible for overseeing housing policy, such as the US Federal Housing and Urban Development department. To his credit, Prime Minister Scott Morrison promised at the last election to beef up the existing National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation with more research powers to the tune of $5 million a year, adding to its existing twin responsibilities to both oversee Morrison's election announcement of a first home loan guarantee scheme and his announcement as Treasurer in the 2017 budget of funding to help the community housing sector gain access to cheap credit. This rebuilding of an institutional capacity at the national level to deal with housing issues is an important first step. But there are plenty of others too.
 
 Reform of tax breaks on housing, most pressingly on investment housing, must be on the table, the authors argue. As must a switch in the tax base of state governments from stamp duty to a land tax. Targets must also be set to ensure new developments include affordable rental housing in well-located areas to house key workers.
 
 All renters need greater rights to long-term and stable leases.
 
 And those pushed into the public housing system by increasing demand in the private rental market need quality housing that does not compound the disadvantage they already face.
 
 In short, Australians deserve a national strategy to ensure access to stable and affordable housing - not just the politicians' latest trick.",966
251,The hardest thing Morrison will ever do comes next,Fairfax,2020-05-21T03:20:08.194Z,"Pollsters are reporting a rare emotion sweeping Australia: pride. Inundated with images of the horrors the coronavirus is wreaking on other nations, Australians are very happy with the way this country has responded.
 
 When the crisis came, the national institutions stood up. The political class, pulled together, not apart. Our health and social security systems survived a once-in-a-century stress test.
 
 Critically, Australians heeded the call to take radical action to protect their lives and did not rebel against draconian restrictions.
 
 None of this was a given. In the early days of the crisis, the national security committee of cabinet planned for the worst: civil unrest. The response was not perfect and it's not over, as a long march through winter lies ahead.
 
 Those who measure the public mood also report that people are willing their leaders to succeed, which makes sense when their success is a matter of life and death for constituents. It explains why the Prime Minister, premiers and chief ministers are flying in the polls. That's being replicated around the globe. A comparison of world leaders' approval ratings published by The Economist shows Scott Morrison has had the greatest uptick of any.
 
 So far, Morrison is winning the war, but can he win the peace?
 
 Examples of leaders who excelled in a crisis and fell in the aftermath abound. It seems timely to note that Winston Churchill had led Britain through five years of war when victory in Europe was declared on May 8, 1945. Just 58 days later, Labour won the general election in a landslide. A people exhausted by war wanted someone to shape their future in peace.
 
 British Labour's 1945 manifesto ""Let Us Face the Future"" began with a pointed observation that ""this war will have been won by the people, not by any one man"", to raze the pillar on which Churchill stood.
 
 It reminded people of pre-war hardships and railed against the ""hard-faced men and their political friends"" who had profited after the First World War. It promised a bright new social order with better housing, free healthcare and jobs linking craftsmen to the genius of scientists and technicians.
 
 In the wake of this crisis, Labor believes its values will suit a time when big government has shown its value. Anthony Albanese calls it a ""once-in-a-century moment to rethink and renew"".
 
 ""We need investment in people, in technology, in infrastructure and in the capacity of government to do good, if we are to be better prepared not just for the next crisis, but for the challenges of the next decade,"" he said.
 
 It's fair to say that just about everyone in politics who envisions a better world reckons it will be built with the tools in the ideological barrow they pushed in. We can't know the future but it will probably be fashioned by those who best capture the powerful emotions that will follow this crisis. People might be proud now, but they are also afraid and could become very angry.
 
 The threat to the Morrison government isn't managing the disease, it's unwinding the cure. This recession was manufactured by all of Australia's governments but it is being bankrolled by the Commonwealth. When the immediate threat fades, don't expect the states to stand arm-in-arm with the feds if the unemployment they all induced stays persistently high.
 
 Nearly half of Australia's pre-coronavirus workforce is now on a government payment; with 5 million people on the JobKeeper allowance and 1.5 million on JobSeeker. Tapering that back to something approaching normal will be the political equivalent of landing a spaceship on a snowflake.
 
 A cliff is looming in September when the JobSeeker payment is due to halve and the JobKeeper allowance cuts out. That will come as deferred business loans start falling due. It's also likely Australia will still be running a twilight economy, where cafes, restaurants, pubs, clubs and bars aren't allowed to operate to capacity.
 
 If that is the equation, then thousands of businesses will fold and the Centrelink lines will grow sickeningly long again. How can any government in good conscience slash people's unemployment benefits when it decreed the destruction of their jobs?
 
 Unwinding these lifelines without pole-axing the goodwill he now enjoys will be the hardest thing Morrison ever has to do.
 
 The engineering flaw in ""building a bridge to the other side"" was always that building had to begin before the chasm could be measured. And the other side still looks a long way from here.

252,The people demand refugees be helped,Fairfax,2021-12-01T08:46:35.797Z,"My mum was 18 years old when she escaped the Chilean coup d'etat in 1973. With the backing and support of the United States, the democratically elected government of president Salvador Allende was overthrown by General Augusto Pinochet, whose brutal regime murdered thousands, imprisoned and tortured its political rivals and allowed corruption to run rampant.
 
 My mum, Trish, was one of those interrogated and detained. Eventually, she escaped from the country, smuggled out with her brother and mother, to join her father here in Australia.
 
 She came here when Malcolm Fraser, leader of the Liberal Party, was prime minister. Fraser understood the importance of providing a safe haven to people seeking safety and the value of multiculturalism.
 
 If we fast-forward to 2020, unfortunately much of that compassion, sense of global responsibility and spirit of inclusion has been lost in our federal leadership. The federal government's response to coronavirus has left refugees and asylum seekers out in the cold. At a time when they need our help the most, thousands of people in our community have been left without access to basic healthcare, income support or visa certainty. This approach mystifies me.
 
 But the hardline attitudes of our federal leaders don't reflect those of our community.When the City of Sydney surveyed more than 3000 people to learn what the community wanted in our COVID-19 recovery plan, nearly three-quarters said their highest priority was that we support our community's most vulnerable people.
 
 At a national level, what needs to be done? The federal government should give refugees and asylum seekers access to Medicare, JobKeeper and JobSeeker, and give temporary visa holders peace of mind by speeding up and simplifying the visa process.
 
 What we're seeing in Victoria now shows us this crisis is not over and we have to provide a safety net for our entire community.
 
 Future generations will look back on the way that Australia has treated refugees and people seeking asylum, particularly through this moment of crisis, and they will judge the compassion of our response.

253,The rights older workers don't know they have,Fairfax,2020-07-12T19:34:43.087Z,"If you're 55 or over, there's a workplace right you might not know you have. Most people know parents have the right to request flexible work if they are caring for a young child. But the Fair Work Act also extends this right - with conditions - to other groups: carers, people with a disability, anyone experiencing family violence ... and people aged 55 and over.
 
 Now, I believe that flexibility should be offered to all employees if possible. We all have lives outside of work and offering the benefit to everyone inspires inclusivity and collegiality. But the legal right to request flexibility - which can only be refused on reasonable business grounds - is given to particular groups because it's needed to foster good social outcomes and encourage workforce participation.
 
 So why do the 55s-and-over need it and how can they use it strategically? Consider this: what age are you going to retire and what do you mean by ""retire"", anyway?
 
 Working full-time until your 65th birthday and then stopping work one Friday afternoon, never to return, is no longer what retirement looks like for most people. It's also one of the worst things you can do for your mental health.
 
 Too much work is bad for your health - it keeps you sedentary and stressed and stops you ticking off life dreams. But too little work isn't great either. A number of studies show work - in moderation - boosts your mental wellness, giving purpose and structure to your day and alleviating loneliness.
 
 Working is also financially beneficial, an important consideration given the longevity factor. Australians have an average life expectancy in their 80s. Many Baby Boomers are wealthy but many are not. There is a safety net in the form of the age pension but many rely on their personal funds, too, and fear it will run dry too soon.
 
 I don't buy into the fearmongering by super funds - they're talking their own book because they want more funds under management. As the Grattan Institute has pointed out, the super industry definition of a ""comfortable lifestyle"" in retirement is far more comfortable than most people experience in their working lives.
 
 But plenty of older workers could find they don't have enough saved to fund what they consider to be a comfortable lifestyle and decide they want to keep working beyond retirement age.
 
 Another bogeyman is changes in your industry could leave you out of a job sooner than planned. Age discrimination is real and the truth is that being unemployed and job-hunting in your late 50s or 60s is a dispiriting exercise.
 
 Or perhaps you simply fancy the idea of a ""portfolio career"" in retirement - a bit of this, a bit of that, using your skills, experience and contacts in new ways, consulting, coaching and controlling your hours, but nothing too arduous. You need to start earlier than you think.
 
 In fact, I was recently given a rather confronting piece of advice when speaking to Sarah Cotton, an organisational psychologist at Transitioning Well. She told me you need to start in your 40s and the workplace right for 55-year-olds and over to request flexibility is designed to allow a transition to retirement, rather than a sudden stop.
 
 People aged 55 and over might need flexibility to stay on top of their health, or care for an elderly parent, or do volunteer work. But equally, they can use it to prepare for a second career.
 
 Of course, there's always the gig economy to supplement retirement income. Yet every ride-share driver I ever meet tells me how little money they make. Working on the non-retirement retirement plan a little earlier in your career will ensure you have other options.

254,They’re all getting in on the act,News,2021-06-04T16:30:38.746Z,"THE artistic community is being bullied by a monster of its own making. Cancel culture has come for the acting profession as it has for every artistic pursuit from music to literature. One cannot deny the delicious irony of the left eating its own with even the most PC “progressive” projects thwarted by the very ideology that the industry panders to: identity politics-obsessed grievance mongering — woke wankery.
 
 In recent weeks we’ve seen a number of examples of artistic integrity being compromised by new rules designed to protect the feelings of the perpetually aggrieved.
 
 Last week a production about the LGBT community, starring a member of the LGBT community, was cancelled because the lead actor was the wrong letter in the LGBT melange, according to LGBT activists.
 
 Hugh Sheridan’s casting was deemed deeply offensive and hurtful. The Queer Artist Alliance Australia were among those critical of a non-trans actor being cast in the lead role. “The choice to cast a cis-gender male as a transgender character is offensive and damaging to the trans community,” it wrote.
 
 The team behind the production issued a grovelling statement about “diversity” and “inclusivity” and promptly withdrew the musical from the 2021 Sydney Festival.
 
 But that little Australian furore was nothing compared to the international backlash faced by Aussie songstress Sia who made the egregious error of casting a non-autistic actor to play an autistic teenager in a film she wrote and directed.
 
 Sia was slammed for having a “neurotypical” (yes, that’s a word now) actor play the non-verbal autistic lead, despite her protestations about supporting diversity by casting trans folk and having “people on the spectrum” advising her.
 
 The National Autistic Society, the American Association of People with Disabilities and a multitude of activists and actors lambasted her for casting a non-disabled actor to play a disabled character.
 
 She should’ve just apologised and begged for forgiveness. That’s what Oscar winner Anne Hathaway did this month when she was censured for playing a witch with three fingers on each hand. She issued a ridiculous statement apologising to “people with limb differences”. What utter madness.
 
 How about allowing actors to act rather than rely on lived experience to play a role? Otherwise we better have Daniel Day-Lewis give back his Oscar for My Left Foot.

255,Timely moves to ease legal burden on abuse victims,Fairfax,2021-12-22T03:24:32.924Z,"Powerful and profound changes have been generated by the royal commission that in recent years examined thousands of instances of sexual abuse of children in Australian institutions. Not the least is a more comprehensive understanding of both the insidious nature of child sexual abuse and the devastating impact it can have on individuals. That understanding is influencing the community's response to complaints and the structure of judicial processes.
 
 Among the commission's recommendations are practical proposals for reforming the criminal justice system to improve prospects for complainants in child sexual abuse cases. This includes suggestions for lowering what are very high hurdles on the way to proving allegations against offenders.
 
 While the royal commission was preparing its final report in mid-2017, the High Court was considering some of these issues in a case involving Robert Lindsay Hughes, the actor who was convicted in the NSW District Court in 2014 over sexual offences against five female children.
 
 The question at issue in the High Court involved the use of so-called tendency and coincidence evidence, sometimes called similar-fact or propensity evidence. This is evidence showing a defendant had a tendency to engage or, indeed, had engaged previously in certain misconduct and was therefore likely to engage in such conduct again. In the Hughes case, the High Court noted that the NSW and Victorian courts of appeal had reached different conclusions about precisely what kind of tendency evidence could be admissible. In a submission to the High Court, the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions supports the broader approach adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in NSW, which did not require the specific acts to be necessarily similar. The High Court found four to three in favour of the NSW approach.
 
 Two months later, the royal commission urged legislators to explicitly abolish common law principles or rules that restricted the use of similar-fact or propensity evidence. It also recommended allowing prosecutors to use evidence of a defendant's prior convictions or charges (except if acquitted) in relation to child sexual assaults. Last week, the NSW government made the first move to amend its legislation. Allegations involving multiple complainants against a single defendant may now be aggregated into a single trial.
 
 Tendency or coincidence evidence has always been a highly contentious area of law, particularly in cases involving child sexual abuse. The secrecy, confusion and fear inflicted on abused children mean these crimes are often not reported for many years, by which time the best evidence available to a court might amount to one word against another. When paedophiles often stridently deny such allegations, and the victim is left to explain in excruciating detail the abuse that happened, juries (or a judge) must decide whom to believe. That places the child complainant in an invidious position.
 
 As the ABC's Four Corners revealed recently, a 15-year-old St Kevin's College schoolboy, Paris Street, was required to endure two days of intense cross-examination in a case involving Peter Kehoe, an athletics coach who made repulsive, criminal sexual approaches. Kehoe was found guilty of grooming and ended up with a non-custodial community corrections order.
 
 The challenge commonly made by the defence is that the child invented the whole thing or somehow misinterpreted the perpetrator's actions. Proof of previous misconduct can go a long way to undermining that line of defence.
 
 Moves to ease the burden on victims are both welcome and necessary. At the same time, courts should not underestimate how community expectations have changed in terms of sentencing. In short, courts need to get tougher. The public gets a confused signal when courts grant groomers - as was the case of Kehoe - non-custodial community corrections orders.

257,Too soon to talk about silver linings?,Fairfax,2021-07-24T22:25:36.797Z,"""Even in our grimmest moments,"" said the wonderful Jess Hill when accepting the Stella Prize this week, ""we can hold despair in one hand, and hope in the other."" Jess has documented many grim moments in her superb, rightfully lauded book, See What You Made Me Do, examining the disturbing prevalence of domestic abuse in this country.
 
 I was struck by this simple truth when she said it. We know we can see beauty in times of ugliness, dream of motion in times of stasis and hope in times of despair.
 
 Even though, to be honest, I have wrestled with the fact that many of us raced so quickly, almost instantly, to find ""silver linings"" during a time of global turmoil, brutal suffering and intolerable pain. I get it, we need it, but #blessed talk sticks in my craw. Much of the ""look on the bright side talk"", while well meaning, can smack of privilege; perhaps I saw one too many trays of hot cross buns, scored sourdough rounds (and, again, it's not the fact of this but the volume), or videos of celebrities telling us of the pain of being confined in well-stocked palaces. When so many are losing people they love, jobs, businesses, apparent futures, it has seemed a little premature.
 
 One thing we have seen in the past few weeks is how this pandemic and shutdown has led to an instant, raw exposure of disadvantage (especially due to race and poverty), and how the most vulnerable will suffer the most: the casually employed, the poor, the homeless (sleeping in painted boxes in parking lots), the victims of domestic abuse. We toss and turn with reason: until we look after those in most need, we can't sit on our haunches. But then I realised two things. First, the craving for light is innately human and will enable all of us to survive this whole thing, as it has in ages past. That the full daftness, kindness, irrepressible creative energy, laughter and joy of people of all stripes is irrepressible.
 
 That delight comforts. That paying attention to the world, to the beauty in it, and to each other is crucial. We need our bards, and poets, our singers and dancers and dreamers and the chortles of children.
 
 And second, that perhaps the best, truest silver lining will be if we are forced to focus on the suffering and struggles of other people, and recognise that with sufficient will, we can do a whole lot more to alleviate it.
 
 Like the speed with which we hopped into action to find - yes temporary but still - housing for the homeless. To raise Newstart, which has not been increased since 1994. Some other surprising and deliriously welcome outcomes are also evident. Have you noticed the movement of experts to the forefront of public debate? Because we actually need them and not the views of ideologically driven pundits? Because our lives depend on it. Scientists have been scoffed at and dismissed for so long for their work on climate change that it has been excellent to see them take centre stage.
 
 I've never heard the word epidemiologist uttered so much on the airwaves. No one is going to turn to an anti-vaxxer for some kind of false balance. Then there's the historically underpaid and undervalued health workers who are saving our lives by risking their own: each night, hundreds of thousands of people have leaned out of windows applauding them. (Seriously can we pay nurses more please? Teachers too? Haven't we seen how much we need them?)
 
 Nor are we asking celebrities for their opinion on much, partly because - well, who cares - but also because so many of their utterances, from plush compounds with pools and thick green grass - have been tone deaf.
 
 There is also reason to hope the earth might have a little time to heal while planes and entire populations are grounded, when we are consuming and discarding less. The Himalayas are emerging from clouds of pollution and there are patches of blue sky above parts of China for the first time in many years. Fish are swimming in clear canals in Venice. Will we return to the climate change debate with a new sense of what might be possible?

258,TREASURER’S CREDIBILITY JUST WENT BACKWARDS BY $60BN,News,2020-07-24T12:20:54.643Z,"Scheme’s mismanagement means unfair outcomes for thousands of Australians “No doubt many people will crawl out of the woodwork to claim credit for the government’s JobKeeper payment. The truth is the policy was developed by the Prime Minister, myself and the Finance Minister, with the strong support of the Treasury secretary and other agencies.” — Josh Frydenberg, The Australian In March, the Treasurer was triumphant in claiming credit for the JobKeeper program and declared it was an unprecedented package designed for unprecedented circumstances. This came after weeks of resisting calls from the opposition and employer groups for a scheme just like it.
 
 Now, as the nation edges towards June, Australians will remember JobKeeper as unprece­dented for another reason entirely. For months we’ve been told that this wage subsidy scheme would cover more than six million Australians at a cost of $130bn.
 
 Now we’re told the figure is actually 3.5 million Australians at a cost of $70bn. It is little more than half of what the government has been claiming. It’s a mathematical error so big you could see it from outer space.
 
 The government was claiming JobKeeper of that size was necessary to save the economy. If that was so, then by the same logic JobKeeper halved must be providing half the necessary support.
 
 This failure of leadership has very real consequences for very real people — and those consequences will have a ripple effect well into the future.
 
 The people we’re talking about, of course, are the hundreds of thousands of Australians who are not eligible to receive JobKeeper because the government deliberately chose to exclude them.
 
 We’re talking about the hundreds of thousands of Australian workers excluded from JobKeeper payments on the basis that the program was full.
 
 We’re talking about more than a million casual workers employed for less than a year; employees of councils and universities, and people who work in the entertainment industry. In denying these workers support, the government sent a clear message that some Australians are less worthy of support than others.
 
 This must be galling to those in the entertainment industry — performers, roadies and sound technicians — who donated their time for free to deliver the Concert for National Bushfire Relief in February. Ironically, many of these entertainers and creative-industries workers are the first people most of us have turned to, to pass our time in isolation. They’re the people who produce our TV shows, films, music and books.
 
 They’ve been happy to help their fellow Australians in their time of need. But in their own time of need, they are being left out. It’s not good enough.
 
 The JobKeeper scheme is a good idea. Indeed, it was Labor that first suggested to the Morrison government early in mid-March that it create a wage subsidy system to help keep people who had lost their jobs in contact with their employers. We argued wage subsidies would preserve the link between employer and employee so they could reunite after the crisis had passed.
 
 Initially, the government refused. Then, on March 30, it relented. But the problem is that the scheme has been poorly designed and poorly targeted. Too many Australians have been excluded, while many more are receiving more money under JobKeeper than they received when they were working.
 
 Take this simple proposition.
 
 A university student living with his parents and earning $200 a week doing a couple of shifts in a fast-food store gets $1200 a week under JobKeeper.
 
 At the same time, a single mum of three who relies on her casual work to put food on the table does not receive JobKeeper simply because she worked in that job less than 12 months. That just doesn’t make sense.
 
 The government created these unfair outcomes. From the day JobKeeper was announced, we’ve implored the government to fix it.
 
 Instead, we’re told the government had to draw a line in the sand somewhere for the benefit of the nation’s finances. But, while the line in the sand was drawn at $130bn a week ago, it has suddenly been redrawn at $70bn.
 
 It has become quicksand, with the Treasurer’s credibility sinking beneath it. Objectively, this is the biggest blunder any government has made in any budget at any point in the history of this commonwealth.
 
 And my simple question is this: If we can’t trust the government to get its numbers right, how can we trust it to get the economic recovery right?
 
 No amount of spin from Frydenberg can conceal the scale of his epic miscalculation of the cost and coverage of his $60bn JobKeeper debacle.
 
 In rhetorical terms, Frydenberg has claimed credit for this colossal mistake. He has claimed responsibility.
 
 But to be truly accountable, he should front up to the Australian parliament and explain himself. He should accept the invitation of the COVID-19 Senate select committee to give evidence about what led to this extraordinary error.
 
 Australians have had enough of this government ducking for cover whenever things go wrong.
 
 It won’t accept responsibility for sports rorts.
 
 Angus Taylor won’t accept responsibility for fraudulent documents being given to newspapers.
 
 Frydenberg must break the pattern and account for the $60bn JobKeeper blunder. But, beyond this, he must re-examine the program’s anomalies and design faults. If this does not occur, the recession will be deeper, the unemployment rate will be higher and many more Australians will be doing it tougher than is necessary.

259,True leadership means not turning a blind eye,Fairfax,2021-04-26T23:53:28.146Z,"One of the most damning revelations during the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was how leaders within certain institutions were willing to cover up the appalling actions of individuals. Turning a blind eye, not believing victims' stories, shutting down whistleblowers - time after time, leaders put protecting the reputation of an institution above the safety of the children in their care, and kept dark secrets behind closed doors.
 
 So it should be applauded when leaders of powerful institutions with esteemed reputations are willing to confront head on the shocking failures of the past. One such leader is Major-General Adam Findlay, the senior army officer in charge of Australia's special forces.
 
 In one of the biggest scandals to face the Australian military in years, it was alleged that some elite soldiers within the SAS committed war crimes in Afghanistan. Senior NSW judge Paul Brereton has overseen a long-running investigation into the claims. For a unit that had a reputation for attracting the army's best of the best, it was a stunning and damning revelation.
 
 In an extraordinary confidential briefing to dozens of troops at SAS headquarters, General Findlay has admitted that some elite soldiers did commit war crimes in Afghanistan. And he did not stop there. ""There are guys who criminally did something. But can you tell me, why was that?"" General Findlay asked the soldiers at the briefing. He pointed the finger at ""one common cause . . . poor leadership. In fact, it is poor moral leadership.""
 
 He went on to say that people within the SAS who ""had nothing to do with this"" now had to ""serve to make this place better and pay for the sins"" of others. ""We have to continue the cultural and governance change. For a lot of reasons but because it is right.""
 
 The words are worth repeating - because it is right. These words have power. It is right that anyone who carried out war crimes is brought to justice. It is right that the victims of those crimes are given reparations. It is right that the whistleblowers were given the protection and forum to be heard and believed. It is right that General Findlay has confronted the wrongs of the past.
 
 He is not the only leader recently to show such mettle. Susan Kiefel, Chief Justice of the High Court, is another. Her words in response to allegations by six women of sexual harassment during former judge Dyson Heydon's decade on the bench are also worth repeating: ""We're ashamed that this could have happened at the High Court of Australia. We have made a sincere apology to the six women whose complaints were borne out. We know it would have been difficult to come forward. Their accounts of their experiences at the time have been believed.""
 
 That is not a person taking a backward step in publicly airing wrongs of the past. That is not a person trying to put the reputation of the highest court in the land before the women making the accusations. Her words sent shockwaves through the legal community, as they should. But they should go further than that. They should be heard by every leader of an institution or business or organisation who is confronted with such wrongs of the past.
 
 It is no longer acceptable to turn a blind eye, to not give whistleblowers or victims the right to be heard and believed, to not investigate claims of wrongdoing. That must be demonstrated by the actions of leaders, for one simple reason. Because it is right.",606

 With our support, Ali has found a job in a pet food factory. His work, packing feed and straw into bags, is demanding, hot and dusty. He rises at 4.30am to travel the two hours to get to work and then back again. Before securing work, he volunteered by delivering care packages to disadvantaged families.

 During last summer’s bushfires several migrant organisations stepped up to provide meals to exhausted firefighters. This speaks volumes about the resilience of refugees and migrants, many of whom have survived difficulties, including conflict, the loss of loved ones, torture and trauma.
 
 But while migrants and refugees are optimistic and keen to do the right thing by society in the face events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, they are also among the most vulnerable to its negative impacts. They have been among the hardest hit by COVID interruptions to education, with parents often struggling to help their kids learn remotely at home.
 
 The latest Australian Labour Market Update from the National Skills Commission shows the pandemic is having a devastating impact on economic growth and labour activity in Australia — and especially for migrants and refugees.
 
 Since March, the gap in unemployment rates between migrants and the Australian-born population has widened to almost 2 per cent. Now, there are proportionately twice as many migrants and refugees looking for work as Australian-born jobseekers.
 
 The sectors that have lost most jobs include transport, warehousing, retail, accommodation and food services — all of which have high proportions of migrant workers.
 
 So, as we move to recover from the crisis and rebuild our economy and restore our social networks and infrastructure, we should ensure everyone, including the most vulnerable among us, is on board. CATH SCARTH IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF AMES AUSTRALIA",414
262,"Wake up, Australia, there will be no easy snapback",News,2021-12-14T00:34:51.116Z,"Political leaders must abandon lazy ways on the economy Every ray of sunshine is welcome in the bleak midwinter of the coronavirus recession. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting Australia, alone among rich nations, will suffer a milder-than-anticipated drop in gross domestic product of 4.5 per cent this year, down from an April prediction of a 6.7 per cent contraction. That’s in line with the view of our top advisers. Treasury had initially expected a 20 per cent slump in GDP this quarter, and a similar fall in the number of hours worked. As well, Moody’s reconfirmed Australia’s AAA sovereign credit rating, putting us in an elite club of 10 countries rated AAA by all three global ratings agencies.
 
 But cold reality bites back. In its latest world outlook, the IMF revealed the pandemic will lead to a 4.9 per cent plunge in global economic activity this year, compared with a 3 per cent fall it had forecast in April. We are an open, trading economy, so that will keep a lid on recovery and getting people back to work. COVID-19 is unleashing cyclical and structural change across industries and in the labour market. On Thursday, Qantas said it was sacking 6000 people. “These are hard days, Australia,” Scott Morrison said, presaging more difficult moments ahead. Commonwealth Bank economists predict the number of unemployed will surge past one million in September, ahead of the withdrawal of emergency fiscal support at the end of that month. No one in government is now talking about “snapback”, a term deployed three months ago to signal a return to normal settings in welfare and a halt to Keynesian “whatever it takes”.
 
 Certainly there is intense lobbying from business and community groups to avoid a “fiscal cliff” when JobKeeper ends and the dole returns to normal. As well, there will be pressure on state and territory leaders to reopen borders and ease restrictions. The Prime Minister again stated medical advice has never been to close borders. Outbreaks will occur, but we have tools and processes to deal with them as long as we operate in a COVID-safe way, in business and in social life. The last thing we want is a “go, stop, go, stop” rhythm. But even assuming a smooth transition out of shutdown, and success in fighting the virus, post-pandemic Australia will be a jobless devastation zone. This will likely be the worst economic calamity in 90 years, nothing like the drop in GDP in the early 1980s or the “recession we had to have” at the start of the 90s.
 
 All organisations are adjusting how they work, searching for cost savings as operating budgets are slashed for the coming financial year. It should put into perspective the shameful carry-on of NSW public servants over a wage freeze and other proposed mild administrative reforms in other sectors. The slack in the labour market, with a record under-utilisation rate of more than 20 per cent and hundreds of thousands exiting the job search, is here to stay. As Mark Wooden noted in his dissenting view in the annual wage review by the Fair Work Commission, a return to pre-recession employment levels can take a long time: in the 80s it took six years for the unemployment rate to recover and more than 10 years in the 90s. Professor Wooden said there was a distinct possibility that many who lose their job or are entering the workforce this year “will be consigned to a future of long-term unemployment and/or permanently reduced career earnings”.
 
 This should be a wake-up call for the political class in Canberra and beyond to focus on the main game of growth, jobs, productivity and living standards. A month ago, Mr Morrison declared we had to reset and go for growth of 3.5 per cent each year — one percentage point above our long-run average — for five years to claw back the lost ground from this disaster. He got a tick for ambition but economists were sceptical about the chances of meeting that target. Why? Because of two decades of complacency on supply-side reform. Those lost years were hurting us pre-crisis — anaemic growth in GDP and incomes, falling productivity and new start-ups, and capital shallowing — and they’ll hold us back in recovery. We need reforms for a more dynamic economy otherwise, as serial optimist Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe warned, Australia “will meander along with mediocre growth”. Meandering along is not an option for us. Comfortable and relaxed is history. Right now, approvals processes kill projects. Our industrial system delivers the world’s highest minimum wage but not the flexibility or simplicity for job creation in new areas. The tax system should try to promote expansion and innovation. State taxes hold back the movement of capital and labour. Yet, apart from the notable exception of NSW leaders, like Narcissus premiers are falling in love with their reflections rather than getting busy on retooling their states. The Morrison government is doing running repairs on workplace laws, skills and red tape, while building a debt mountain. Josh Frydenberg’s economic statement next month and October budget will reveal how much political will, energy and imagination the government has for reform or if policy incrementalism is its comfort zone. But the Coalition is unlikely to get any help for business-friendly policies from Anthony Albanese, despite an apparent Road to Eden-Monaro conversion on climate and energy policy. Labor is simply striking a pose.",941
263,We have a lethal 'bloke blindspot',Fairfax,2020-04-18T04:36:37.024Z,"Men now account for seven in nine suicides in Australia. There are, however, some reasons to hope.
 
 If we middle-aged white men are running the patriarchy, we should be sacked for not looking after ourselves. The numbers underscore a depressing situation in Australian men's health. Yet positive action on the ground - men taking ownership for their health - and at the national policy level this week are new reasons for optimism.
 
 But first, a portrait of pain for millions of men, their partners and their families: men die six years younger on average than women - at 79 versus 85; men are more likely to die by cancer than women, particularly from bowel, lung and liver cancer; and men account for more than 90 per cent of workplace deaths.
 
 Perhaps the saddest statistic comes from the new data on male suicide in Australia. According to government figures released last month, we reached the highest ever number of male suicides in our history in pre-COVID 2019. Of the 3318 deaths by suicide, 2502 were males and 816 were females. Now, seven of nine daily suicides in Australia are men - more than 75 per cent.
 
 This week it was encouraging to hear the Prime Minister call out the tragic and male-specific aspects of suicide when he released two significant and positive reports: the Productivity Commission on mental health and the interim advice of the new national suicide prevention adviser, Christine Morgan. It was unprecedented. Morgan's report said Australia needed specific strategies to target suicide among men.
 
 And yet Australia has a ""bloke blindspot"" when it comes to this tragedy. The vast majority of formal and funded programs are not made with men in mind. Current policies, such as the 5th National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan, fail to address the very specific challenge as it applies to men. They use techniques, language and approaches that have largely not included men in designing and delivering their own help.
 
 For instance, many of the better known initiatives pose the male-unfriendly and emotionally packed question: ""What are you feeling?"" Whereas we know men broadly respond to: ""What's going on?""
 
 We know that male suicide has specific dimensions. About half are linked with relationship issues, one in six to money concerns and one in 10 to unemployment.
 
 It seems that in our very necessary quest to be inclusive of at-risk groups, such as Indigenous people, the LGBTIQ communities and young women, for whom suicide attempts are increasing - and we absolutely must do this to save lives - we have somehow excluded the group that remains most at risk: men. Perhaps it's so obvious it gets overlooked.
 
 Consistently over the past 10 years, the number of suicide deaths has been about three times higher for males than females. Now is the time to check the policy mirror for our ""bloke blindspot"".
 
 It doesn't help when men's behaviour is sometimes generalised as ""toxic"". Putting aside that ""male toxicity"" is in part an ideologically fuelled stereotype, this is unproductive. Shame and blame don't change someone's behaviour, especially if they are mentally ill or emotionally fragile or developing as men.
 
 As the father of young sons at a private school said to me: ""We know the boys are growing up in a really privileged way. Therefore, it's our job to impart lessons about values like humility and responsibility. But it's hard when there are so many messages out there saying that boys are somehow inherently bad. You can see how that explains a lot of hopelessness and defeat.""
 
 My friend, Gus Worland, the media personality and star of the ABC's groundbreaking Man Up series, tells me he gets 1000 messages a day through social media - from men and those who care about them - concerning suicidality and other emotional crises.
 
 But there is good news, too. In an unprecedented way, hundreds of thousands of men are now taking greater responsibility for their health, especially for their mental wellbeing. It's been part of the COVID-19 phenomenon that literally hundreds of male-built, peer-support groups have emerged online over the past nine months. Men being there for other men.
 
 At the community level, Australian men are leveraging their greatest characteristic: mateship. Hopefully, together with the government's expanded social safety net during the pandemic, this self-help based on lived experience partly explains a curious thing about 2020's suicide rates. At this stage, they are not showing more devastating spikes, despite coronavirus, the lockdowns and the job losses.
 
 Perhaps it is the safety net working. If so, what happens if it is withdrawn?
 
 Clinicians are also understanding that men do communicate about their internal lives. They just do it differently. A counsellor mate working with hi-viz blokes in the Hunter Valley does ""tattoo therapy"". That is, he asks about their ink and they start talking about their lives and struggles.
 
 Let's hope the PM's support, a new evidence base and the movement of mates helping mates come together as a genuine plan to save more of the lives of fathers, sons, brothers and workmates. Not only for their sake but for that of their mothers, wives, sisters and daughters.

264,We must get our mojo working,Fairfax,2021-03-24T14:41:00.646Z,"Polls show Australia is in a pall of pessimism. But beyond these dark days we can make this decade sparkle.
 
 The global news magazine The Economist dedicated a front page to Australia a few years ago with the headline ""Aussie Rules: What the World Can Learn from Australia"".
 
 To be sure, The Economist found good fortune had played a role in Australia's success, blessed as we are with an abundance of natural resources and conveniently close to Asia, which hoovers such things up.
 
 But the magazine also found good policy had played a critical role in making Australia ""probably the most successful country in the rich world"".
 
 Unlike most countries, we had achieved a ""broad consensus"" on key issues such as mass immigration, low public debt, trade policy and an affordable welfare state.
 
 Now, as we enter a new decade, there is a growing number of Australians who view the future with pessimism and believe our best days are behind us. A recent Roy Morgan poll found 40 per cent of respondents think 2020 will be ""worse"" than 2019, the worst poll result in 30 years.
 
 Perhaps this public pessimism is not surprising.
 
 Our nation is in the grip of devastating bushfires and drought caused by climate change, our economy and wages are stagnating, our cities are struggling to manage population growth and congestion, millions of Australians live below the poverty line, and national security is being tested by a new cold war in our region between China and the United States.
 
 The past decade has been a dismal period for national politics, with toxic partisanship and a revolving door of five prime ministers meaning little has been delivered in the way of transformational policy reform.
 
 We measure the life of a country in decades, so let's make the 2020s the decade that Australia gets its mojo back. A decade in which we once again achieve a consensus on the big challenges we face.
 
 Top of the list for a new consensus is energy and climate policy. Australia needs a climate and energy accord, modelled on the approach taken by the Hawke government with the Prices and Incomes Accord and drawing on the Green New Deal in the US.
 
 It can be an environmental, energy and economic plan for Australia that creates more new jobs than it displaces.
 
 Scott Morrison and the Coalition are under serious pressure for not doing enough on emissions to prevent the bushfire and drought crises. Anthony Albanese and Labor need to reconnect with mining communities while taking real action on climate. Why not call a national summit and try some Hawke-style consensus based on science, straight talk and the national interest?
 
 A second major opportunity for a new national consensus centres on how we treat the most vulnerable in our community. There are now 3 million people below the poverty line in Australia, including 740,000 children. This is unacceptable for a country like ours.
 
 Two interventions can help: lifting the Newstart allowance and implementing a housing first policy that offers permanent, affordable housing and support services as quickly as possible for people experiencing homelessness.
 
 Business and social welfare groups have already committed to lifting Newstart. The sharp end of the debate comes down to who pays. As we have seen with the funding model for the NDIS, a new levy that is transparently reported and hypothecated to a housing fund and assistance to the needy is capable of achieving bipartisan support.
 
 A further area ripe for a major shift in thinking is Australia's economic plan. The Australian economy needs to get off its dependency on ""holes"" (mining) and ""houses"" (population growth fuelled by immigration) and focus on enhancing productivity and building a high-wage, value-added knowledge economy.
 
 The old economic consensus of the 1980s built around markets, privatisation and competitive advantage as a static notion is no longer fit for purpose. A new economic consensus needs to be built around a more dynamic view of the drivers of growth based on innovation and an expansion of Australia's technological and industrial capabilities.
 
 Other opportunities for a new national consensus in the 2020s include a national population, infrastructure, land use plan; a coherent foreign policy that asserts Australia's independence in the looming cold war between the US and China; taxation reform (another good candidate for a summit); Indigenous recognition and the voice to Parliament and, of course, the republic.
 
 This is undoubtedly an optimistic list. But Australia has proved in the 1980s and 1990s that it is capable of reaching a broad consensus and achieving difficult but worthwhile transformational reform.
 
 The prospects for success are improved by the seeming return of stability in federal politics. The political class are suffering conflict fatigue, and our political leaders, especially Albanese, are talking the language of consensus. The Victorian Labor government and NSW Coalition government have also shown that reforming governments can still be re-elected.
 
 So maybe, just maybe, the 2020s can be another golden era for policy reform, and when the world looks at Australia in 2030, they will still say ""Aussie rules"".

265,"Why do we blame the jobless, but not greedy CEOs?",Others,2021-04-16T22:09:28.797Z,"I must admit to feeling somewhat flummoxed. It's never been a secret that government welfare policy is less about helping actual people and more about glossing the numbers.
 
 But when their policy decisions don't even support economic principles, I'm left sitting here scratching my head.
 
 The coronavirus has thrown a monumental spanner in the works.
 
 Despite articles everywhere declaring it to be ""unprecedented,"" it's actually not. We survived Spanish Flu in the last century and the world made it through the Plague.
 
 With our interconnected world, it was not unfathomable for something like this to happen again. It's not unprecedented - we were ill-prepared.
 
 We also seem ill-equipped to manage it.
 
 How else can we explain policies that support the rich and leave the vulnerable scrambling for the coat tails of the CEO clan, to lap at the drops of the mythical trickle-down economics we were all informed is an effective way to preserve our financial wellbeing?
 
 You have to have a go to get a go, right?
 
 I am left wondering why we seem to hate welfare recipients so much as a nation.
 
 Our politicians and news media throw out shock jock headlines and quotes calling people experiencing unemployment ""bludgers"", creating the stereotypes of drug addiction, laziness and personal fault and thus cultivating the social division that isolates people suffering the indignity of the dole queue.
 
 Despite actual research debunking these myths, social media shows the success of this cultivation as people degrade those who have been forced to ask for help.
 
 Programs like the Indue cashless debit card beat down the already fragile mental health of those in this position by limiting their agency, publicly declaring their status as a person experiencing hardship, and rendering the relationship between the government and its people as one of parent and child.
 
 The short-term provision of the coronavirus supplement due to be cut this week, perhaps surprisingly, further divided us.
 
 I thought (apparently naively) that an influx of people into the ranks of the unemployed would increase empathy and understanding for their plight, help us all to recognise that unemployment is rarely a choice and the powerlessness of the experience can be as debilitating as it is frustrating.
 
 Alas, it was not to be. Instead, we have somehow managed to create a class society within the welfare structure - those who are new to the program due to the coronavirus and those who were already there and thus ""unworthy"" of the additional support offered during this pandemic.
 
 The impending loss of the supplement will level this playing field somewhat, and the bitter taste of poverty will know no prejudice, with almost a million Australians without even one hour a week of work.
 
 I can only conclude the disdain aimed at people experiencing unemployment is as a result of the carefully cultivated belief that they are in this situation because there is something inherently wrong with them - that they are lacking in the qualities, work ethic or desire to contribute that those in employment clearly bring to the table.
 
 We seem so aghast at the idea that someone could get something for ""doing nothing"" when ""we"" have to work for what we get that we fail to recognise living below the poverty threshold, and straddling the line between homelessness and scraping by, is not a lifestyle people tend to choose.
 
 Giving tax breaks to the rich while freezing the aged pension and cutting JobSeeker back to one of the worst rates in the OECD helps neither the people nor the economy.
 
 But don't stress - the government has provided funding worth just over $4.50 for each of us for mental health. Spend it wisely!
