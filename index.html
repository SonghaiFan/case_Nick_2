      <h1>Talking about disadvantage <br />in public narratives</h1>
      <p>
        To examine how narratives about disadvantage are presented in the
        Australian media, a team of Monash University researchers analysed more
        than two hundred articles from 2020 and further explored whether these
        narratives differ across different types of disadvantaged groups, issues
        and publishers. The dataset was first human-coded – meaning that experts
        analysed the articles to look for emerging themes, keywords and biases –
        which may help in developing machine learning models to track public
        narratives using artificial intelligence.

      <h1>How we collect data and where are they come from?</h1>
      <p>
        We searched the Factiva database of Australian news articles for
        articles related to disadvantage. For example, this article contains key
        words related to themes of disadvantage highlighted in different
        colours.

      <ul>
        <li>
          We searched Factiva using the same set of terms that were developed
          for the review (e.g. disadvantage* OR discrimination OR "access to
          resources" …)
        </li>
        <li>
          We included the most-read newspaper in every state and territory, plus
          The Australian (top national newspaper), Daily Telegraph (second in
          NSW) and Herald Sun (second in Vic)
        </li>
        <li>
          We restricted the searches to Commentaries/Opinions Or Editorials
          published in 2020.

            The top 1000 most 'Relevant' article were downloaded and randomised

            We already know that each color block represents the group or issue
            that the article is coded for, so let's count the total number of
            articles for each group and issue in all coded articles.

        </div>
        <div class="step">

            The bar chart on the right shows that "First Nations" is the most
            mentioned group in all articles.This is followed closely by
            "violence" and "women. Most codes were discussed in less than 25
            articles.
          </p>
          Through a qualitative thematic synthesis of all the group labels
          mentioned, we generated a list of 26 groups that captured all of those
          discussed as disadvantaged in the included articles. We organised
          these groups under seven broad categories: cultural minorities, gender
          and sexuality, age, socioeconomic status, health status,
          institutionalisation, and other.
        </div>
        <div class="step">

            There are total 103 aarticles metioned "first nation" group, include
            38.87% our article collection.
          </p>
          You can hover over the bar chart to see the articles related to that
          code, along with the percentage share and specific counts. Of course,
          don't forget that each square represents an article, and you can also
          hover over it to see the content of the article it represents.

          <p>
            There are too many codes, don't worry, from now on we will only
            focus on the popular ones. We filtered out codes that were mentioned
            less than 25 times. If the article happens to be about only the
            codes that were filtered out, then the article will also be
            excluded.

          <p>The warm color block represents the code for the Group.</p>
          The most-commonly discussed disadvantaged groups were First Nations
          people (103 articles), women (84 articles), racial minorities (42
          articles), children (35 articles), and unemployed people (13.45%).
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>The cold color block represents the code for the Issue.</p>
          The most commonly-discussed specific issues were violence, work, crime
          and health. The most commonly-discussed general issues were prejudice
          and discrimination, followed by inequality, poverty, and human
          rights.

            You may be wondering what the relationship between groups and issues
            looks like. Let's change the measure of this bar chart to
            co-mentions, which means the number of times the group or issue was
            metioned together in all of our collections." "metioned together"
            implies that both group and issue were coded for the same article.

            Noticed the change here.Women, children and people with disabilities
            or chronic diseases moved up the rankings. Of these, those with
            chronic illnesses moved up 3 places, children 2 places and women 1
            place. The unemployment group has moved down in the ranking,
            indicating that this group is indeed discussed more often on its
            own, but it is rarely mentioned together with other issues.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>
            Next, we use the sankey diagram to show the relationship between
            groups and issues. We put group and issue on each side, and the
            height of the node represents the frequency of being mentioned
            together.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>
            The line between nodes represents the relationship between the group
            and the issue being mentioned, and the thickness represents the
            number of common mentions. For example, first nation and violence,
            crime justice and work are mentioned.
