      <h1>Talking about disadvantage <br />in public narratives</h1>
      <p>
        To examine how narratives about disadvantage are presented in the
        Australian media, a team of Monash University researchers analysed more
        than two hundred articles from 2020 and further explored whether these
        narratives differ across different types of disadvantaged groups, issues
        and publishers. The dataset was first human-coded – meaning that experts
        analysed the articles to look for emerging themes, keywords and biases –
        which may help in developing machine learning models to track public
        narratives using artificial intelligence.

        We searched the Factiva database of Australian news articles for
        articles related to disadvantage. For example, this article contains key
        words related to themes of disadvantage highlighted in different
        colours.

            is comparatively lesser than these two major publishers, is

            A total of 3845 articles like these were returned after we searched
            the database for all articles including relevant terms (e.g.
            disadvantage* OR discrimination OR "access to resources" …) The top
            1000 most 'Relevant' article were downloaded and randomised for
            screening and coding. Human coders screened articles (n=588),And
            extracted data from those that met inclusion criteria (n=265), then
            coding stopped.

            As before, we see colour blocks in each article highlighting the key
            words associated with different groups and issues identified by our
            human coders as being related to disadvantage.

            Let's count the total number of articles that mention each group and

            The bar chart on the right shows that "First Nations" is the most

            articles.

            To increase the clarity, the plot included only groups and issues
            that were mentioned at least 25 times in the full dataset. If the
            article happens to be about only the groups and issues that were
            filtered out, then the article will also be excluded.

          <p>The cold color block represents the code for the Group.</p>
          <p>
            The most-commonly discussed disadvantaged groups were First Nations
            people (103 articles), women (84 articles), racial minorities (42
            articles), children (35 articles), and unemployed people (13.45%).
          </p>
          Through a qualitative thematic synthesis of all the group labels
          mentioned, we generated a list of 26 groups that captured all of those
          discussed as disadvantaged in the included articles. We organised
          these groups under seven broad categories: cultural minorities, gender
          and sexuality, age, socioeconomic status, health status,
          institutionalisation, and other.
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <p>The warm color block represents the code for the Issue.</p>
          <p>
            The most commonly-discussed specific issues were violence, work,
            crime and health. The most commonly-discussed general issues were
            prejudice and discrimination, followed by inequality, poverty, and
            human rights. 
          </p>
          Qualitative thematic analysis revealed that articles discussed both
          issues relating to specific forms of deprivation (e.g. violence, work,
          health)(Bessell, 2015), and more general issues (e.g. prejudice and
          discrimination, human rights).

        <div class="step">
          <p>
            We are interested in how different groups of people are discussed in
            relation to different issues related to disadvantage.
          </p>
          <p>Let's bring back all the "groups" and "issues".</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>
            Next, we use the diagram to show the relationship between groups and
            issues. We put group and issue on each side, and the height of the
            node represents the frequency of being mentioned together.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>
            We begin with the first article. The line between nodes represents
            the relationship between the group and the issue being mentioned
            together, and the thickness represents how many times they are
            metioned togerther.
          </p>
          For example, this article is coded as two groups (firstnation, women)
          and two issues (violence, family relation). "firstnation" is
          co-mentioned with "violence" and "family relation", intotal 2 times,
          which you can see from the lable on the graph. each group is
          co-mentioned 2 times with other groups, groups also co-mentioned with
          other issues 2 times. The number is same, because in this article the
          number of groups and issues happen to be the same.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>Now we add one more article into our graph.</p>
          you can hover the link path to see the meaning of the thickness. The
          path element is article-based, which means, wherever you put your
          mouse on, it will highligh the one specific article on the right and
          all other article has the same group-issue relationship.

          <p>
            For example, articles about Aboriginal people often refer to
            violence and crime. In contrast, articles referring to young people
            were characterized by references to work, while articles referring
            to racial minorities often discussed prejudice and discrimination in
            general.
