      <h1>Talking about disadvantage <br />in public narratives</h1>
      <p>
        To examine how narratives about disadvantage are presented in the
        Australian media, a team of Monash University researchers analysed more
        than two hundred articles from 2020 and further explored whether these
        narratives differ across different types of disadvantaged groups, issues
        and publishers. The dataset was first human-coded – meaning that experts
        analysed the articles to look for emerging themes, keywords and biases –
        which may help in developing machine learning models to track public
        narratives using artificial intelligence.

          <h1>How we code an article</h1>
          <p>
            Here is the same article but with color mark. For example, this
            article contains key words related to themes of disadvantage
            highlighted in different colours. In this article, "<span
              style="background-color: rgb(250, 77, 29)"
              >domestic</span
            >" and "<span style="background-color: rgb(250, 77, 29)"
              >violence</span
            >" is highlighted, indicate this article is coded with issues about
            family relationship and violence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">

            As before, we see colour blocks in each article highlighting the key

          <p>
            To increase the clarity, the plot included only groups and issues
            that were mentioned at least 25 times in the full dataset. If the
            article happens to be about only the groups and issues that were
            filtered out, then the article will also be excluded.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h1>Groups</h1>
          <p>
            The cold color block represents the code for the Group.The groups
            described as disadvantaged in each article (e.g. African
            Australians, people on welfare) were recorded in open-text fields
          </p>
          <p>
            The most-commonly discussed disadvantaged groups were strong First
            Nations people (103 articles), women (84 articles), racial
            minorities (42 articles), children (35 articles), and unemployed
            people (13.45%).
          </p>
          Through a qualitative thematic synthesis of all the group labels
          mentioned, we generated a list of 26 groups that captured all of those
          discussed as disadvantaged in the included articles. We organised
          these groups under seven broad categories: cultural minorities, gender
          and sexuality, age, socioeconomic status, health status,
          institutionalisation, and other.
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h1>Issues</h1>
          <p>
            The warm color block represents the code for the Issue. Issues
            relevant to disadvantage were broadly defined as being the things
            that articles considered disadvantaged groups to be deprived of or
            pursuing. These could include, for example, specific material things
            (e.g. shelter, food), opportunities (e.g. work, education), or
            broader rights and concepts (e.g. human rights, social inclusion).
          </p>
          <p>
            The most commonly-discussed specific issues were violence, work,
            crime and health. The most commonly-discussed general issues were
            prejudice and discrimination, followed by inequality, poverty, and
            human rights. 
          </p>
          Qualitative thematic analysis revealed that articles discussed both
          issues relating to specific forms of deprivation (e.g. violence, work,
          health)(Bessell, 2015), and more general issues (e.g. prejudice and
          discrimination, human rights).
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h1>Relationship between Groups and Issues</h1>
          <p>
            We are interested in how different groups of people are discussed in
            relation to different issues related to disadvantage.
          </p>
          <p>Let's bring back all the "groups" and "issues".</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h1>Sankey diamgram</h1>
          <p>
            Next, we use the diagram to show the relationship between groups and
            issues. We put group and issue on each side, and the height of the
            node represents the frequency of being mentioned with other groups
            or issues.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>
            We begin with the first article. The line between nodes represents
            the relationship between the group and the issue being mentioned
            together, and the thickness represents how many times they are
            metioned togerther.
          </p>
          For example, this article is coded as two groups (firstnation, women)
          and two issues (violence, family relation). "firstnation" is
          co-mentioned with "violence" and "family relation", intotal 2 times,
          which you can see from the lable on the graph. each group is
          co-mentioned 2 times with other groups, groups also co-mentioned with
          other issues 2 times. The number is same, because in this article the
          number of groups and issues happen to be the same.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>Now we add one more article into our graph.</p>
          Three groups (firstnation, women, children) and three issues
          (violence, crime, familyrelations) produce 9 links.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>Add one more aricle.</p>
          Four groups (firstnation, women, children, people with disabilities)
          and three issues (violence, familyrelations, shelter) produce 12
          links.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>Fourth aricles.</p>
          Two groups (firstnation, women) and two issues (crime, inequality)
          produce 4 links.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h1>Explore the whole dataset</h1>
          <p>Let's birng all the articles in.</p>
          <p>
            For example, articles about Aboriginal people often refer to
            violence and crime. In contrast, articles referring to young people
            were characterized by references to work, while articles referring
            to racial minorities often discussed prejudice and discrimination in
            general.
          </p>
          you can hover the link path to see the meaning of the thickness. The
          path element is article-based, which means, wherever you put your
          mouse on, it will highligh the one specific article on the right and
          all other article has the same group-issue relationship.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h1>Introduce factor analysis</h1>
          <p>
            Next, let's discuss what are the characteristics of the narrative?
            We used a statistical tool called factor analysis to examine whether
            there were underlying broad narrative dimensions being captured by
            the 18 specific binary indicators we coded on. There are five main
            characteriscs:
            <li>"Amplifies disadvantaged voices "</li>
            <li>"Disparages disadvantaged people"</li>
            <li>"Recognises intersectionality "</li>
            <li>"Provides human examples"</li>
            <li>"Focused on solutions "</li>
          </p>
          We generated composite scores for each of the five factors by
          averaging the relevant binary indicators.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h1>Scatter plot by publisher</h1>
          <p>
            Each article has a score for five characteristics, and we plot these
            scores by different publishers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h1>Scatter plot by characteristics type</h1>
          <p>Then, we split these points by five characteristics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h1>How common are these narrative characteristics?</h1>
          <p>
            This chart shows the extent to which articles had each of the five
            narrative characteristics. It's a slight over simplification to say
            these represent percentages, but they aren't far off. For
            simplicity, we can say that about half of articles amplified
            disadvantaged voices, about 16% disparage disadvantaged people,
            about 35% reconogise intersectionality, about 36% provide human
            examples, and roughly 60% focus on solutions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h1>Grouped barchart by publishers</h1>

          </p>
          Bars were divided to grouped bars to compare scores across publishers
          cross-sectionally. Significant differences were found in "amplifies
          the voices of the disadvantaged"; "disparages disadvantaged people"
          and "focused on solutions."

            usually providing personal examples or personal vignettes that
