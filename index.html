      <h1>Talking about disadvantage <br />in public narratives</h1>
      <p>
        To examine how narratives about disadvantage are presented in the
        Australian media, a team of Monash University researchers analysed more
        than two hundred articles from 2020 and further explored whether these
        narratives differ across different types of disadvantaged groups, issues
        and publishers. The dataset was first human-coded, which may help in
        developing machine learning models to track public narratives using
        artificial intelligence.

            A square or rectangle represents one of our collection of aricles,
            with consistent visual semantics through the following
            visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
            The color block represents the narrative disadvantage content of the
            article being coded, which warm color for groups and cold color for
            issues metioned in this article.

            Factiva search returned n=3845 documents that included that search
            terms.
          </p>
          We searched Factiva using the same set of terms that were developed
          for the review (e.g. disadvantage* OR discrimination OR "access to
          resources" ‚Ä¶)<br />

          We included the most-read newspaper in every state and territory, plus
          The Australian (top national newspaper), Daily Telegraph (second in
          NSW) and Herald Sun (second in Vic)<br />

          We restricted the searches to Commentaries/Opinions Or Editorials
          published in 2020.

        <div class="step">
          <p>
            The top 1000 most 'Relecant' article were downloaded and randomised
            for screening and coding.

            And extracted data from those that met inclusion criteria (n=265),
            then coding stopped.
          </p>
          Opinion pieces will be the focus of this study because they: (1) are
          likely to contain more narrative content (as opposed to the factual
          content that is generally presented in news stories); (2) typically
          highlight salient issues that are the forefront of public debate
          (Golan, 2010); (3) can impact public opinion and voting behaviour
          (Dalton et al., 1998; Druckman & Parkin, 2005; (4) are available in
          volumes that¬† are more amenable to human coding than other larger
          datasets, such as factual news stories; and, (5) were considered to be
          high-priority by the expert advisory panel. <br />
          NOTE: the 265 number is only for this visualization show case, not the
          real project.

            We already know that each color block represents the group or issue
            that the article is coded for, so let's count the total number of
            articles for each group and issue in all coded articles.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>
            The bar chart on the right shows that "First Nations" is the most
            mentioned group in all articles.This is followed closely by
            "violence" and "women. Most codes were discussed in less than 25
            articles.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>
            You can hover over the bar chart to see the articles related to that
            code, along with the percentage share and specific counts. Of
            course, don't forget that each square represents an article, and you
            can also hover over it to see the content of the article it
            represents.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <p>
            There are too many codes, don't worry, from now on we will only
            focus on the popular ones. We filtered out codes that were mentioned
            less than 25 times. If the article happens to be about only the
            codes that were filtered out, then the article will also be
            excluded.

        <div class="step">
          <p>The warm color block represents the code for the Group.</p>

        <div class="step">

            You may be wondering what the relationship between groups and issues
            looks like. Let's change the measure of this bar chart to
            co-mentions, which means the number of times the group or issue was
            metioned together in all of our collections." "metioned together"
            implies that both group and issue were coded for the same article.
